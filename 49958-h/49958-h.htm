<h2>Familiar Talk with the Reader.</h2>


<p>“Do not laugh when I tell you that one of the most
serious perplexities of my every-day life is the daily recurring
question, ‘What shall we have for dinner?’” writes
a correspondent.</p>

<p>I do not smile at the naïve confession. I feel more
like sighing as I recollect the years during the summers
and winters of which the same query advanced with me
into the dignity of a problem. There were several important
ends to be compassed in the successful settlement
of the question. To accomplish an agreeable variety
in the family bill of fare; to accommodate appetites
and individual preferences to the season and state of the
local market; to avoid incongruous associations of meats,
vegetables, sauces, <i>entrées</i> and desserts; to build fragments
into a structure about which should linger no flavor
of staleness or sameness; so to manage a long succession
of meals that yesterday’s repast and the more frugal one
of to-day should not suggest the alternation of fat and lean
in the Hibernian’s pork, or the dutiful following of penance
upon indulgence; to shun, with equal care, the rock
of parsimony and the whirlpool of extravagance;—but why
extend the list of dilemmas? Are they not written in the
mental chronicles of every housewife whose conscience—be
her purse shallow or deep—will not excuse her from a
continual struggle with the left-overs? Such uncompromising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
bits of facts do these same “left-overs” appear in
the next day’s survey of ways, means, and capabilities,
that timid mistresses are the less to blame for often winking
at the Alexandrine audacity with which the cook has
disposed of the knotty subject by emptying platters and
tureens into the swill-pail,—which should stand for the
armorial bearings of her tribe wherever found,—or satisfied
indolence, and what goes with her for humanity, by tossing
crusts, bones, and “cold scraps” into the yawning
basket of the beggar at the basement door.</p>

<p>One of these days I mean to write an article, scientific
and practical, upon the genus, “basket-beggar.” For the
present, take the word of one who has studied the species
in all its varieties,—who has suffered long, and certainly not
been <i>un</i>kind in the acquisition of experience upon this
head,—and prohibit their visits entirely, and at all seasons.
“Cold cuts” and the “heels” of loaves belong to you as
certainly as do hot joints and unmutilated pies. Issue
your declaration of independence to the effect that you
choose to dispense charity in your own way, and that,
as an intelligent Christian woman, you can better judge
by what methods to relieve want and aid the really worthy
poor, than can the ignorant, irresponsible creature who
lavishes what costs her nothing upon every chance speculator
whose lying whine excites her pity. Sympathy
which, by the way, would generally lie dormant, were the
listener to the piteous tale obliged to satisfy the petitioner
from her own purse or wardrobe.</p>

<p>Returning from what is not, although it may seem to
be a digression, let us talk together more briefly than is
our wont in these familiar conferences, of the considerations
that have moved and sustained me in the preparation
of this volume, and which will, I hope, make it a
welcome and useful counsellor to you. First, then, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
suggestion and interrogation of sincere seekers for helpful
advice pertaining to that most important of the triad
of daily meals—“<span class="smcap">The Family Dinner</span>,” superadded to
my own observation and experience of the difficulties
that beset the subject. Secondly, the discovery, that so
far as I have been able to push my investigations—and
my searching has been keen and extensive—no directory
upon this particular branch of culinary endeavor has been
published, at least none in the English language. We
have had books, some of them admirable helps to skilful,
no less than to inexperienced housekeepers, upon dinner-giving,
and company dinners, and “little dinner” parties,
not to refer to the mighty mountain of manuals upon
cookery in general; but, up to the time of the present
writing, I have found nothing that, to my appreciation,
meets the case stated by the friend whose plaint heads this
chapter.</p>

<p>My aim has been to write out, for seven days of four
weeks in each month, a <i>menu</i> adapted, in all things, to
the average American market; giving meats, fish, vegetables,
and fruits in their season, and, so far as I could do so
upon paper, rendering a satisfactory account of every
pound of meat, etc., brought, by my advice, into the kitchen.
I have taken the liberty accorded me by virtue of
our long and intimate acquaintanceship, of inspecting
not only the contents of your market-basket, but each
morning the treasures of larder and refrigerator; of offering
counsel concerning crumbs, bones, and such odds-and-ends
as are held in contempt by many otherwise thrifty
managers—to wit, other cold vegetables than potatoes,
and dry crusts of bread and cake, while of gravy and
dripping I have made specialties. I have tried, moreover,
to inspire such respect for made-over dinners, as we
feel for the pretty rugs made of the ravellings of Axminster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
carpets. We do not attempt to impose them upon
ourselves or our friends as “pure Persian.” But neither
do we blush for them because Mrs. Million Aire across
the way would scorn to give them house-room. Let
“<span class="smcap">Consistency</span>” be stamped upon every appointment of
your household, and even the <i>parvenue</i> opposite cannot
despise you. Once learn the truth that moderate, or
even scanty means do not make meanness or homeliness a
necessity, and act upon the lesson, and you can set criticism
at defiance. Apropos to this point of consistency,
let me say, in explanation, not apology, for the small space
devoted to company-dinners, that I have dealt with them
upon the principle that ten times one makes ten. Having,
in emulation of the Eastern beauty, carried the calf
with ease for four weeks, you will hardly appreciate the
difference in the weight of the cow you lift upon the fifth.
In plainer phrase, give John and the children good dinners,
well-cooked, and daintily served, every day, and the
entertainment of half-a-dozen friends in addition to the
family party will cease to be a stupendous undertaking.
They have a saying in the Southern States that aptly
expresses the labor and excitement attendant upon such
an event in too many families; the straining after Mrs.
Million Aire’s <i>diners à la Russe</i>, which presuppose the
despotism of a <i>chef</i> in the kitchen, and the solemn pomp
of a Chief Butler in the <i>salle à manger</i>. The Southern
description of the frantic endeavor is—“Trying to put the
big pot into the little one,” and it is invariably used with
reference to preparations for company. Be content, my
dear sister, to put into your little pot only so much as it
will decently hold, and be thankful that you have in it a
sure gauge of responsibility.</p>

<p>I have spoken of dinners for four weeks in each month.
I have written receipts for this number, not in forgetfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of the fact that there is but one February per annum,
but because the need of adapting the bills of fare to the
days of the week, instead of the month, was absolute, and if
I wished the Dinner Year-Book to be a perpetual calendar,
I must say nothing of the broken week that sometimes
ends and sometimes begins the month. The difficulty
of disposing satisfactorily of the two or three odd
days brought to my mind, while blocking out my work,
the summary manner in which one of my baby-girls once
dismissed a somewhat analogous difficulty.</p>

<p>“My dear,” I said to her one night as she concluded
her prayer at my knee, “you have forgotten to pray for
your little cousins. How did that happen? Don’t you
want our Heavenly Father to take care of them?”</p>

<p>She made a motion of again bending her knees, yawned
sleepily, and tumbled into bed.</p>

<p>“Can’t help it, mamma! Baby is too tired! Horace
and Eddie <i>must scuffle for themselves</i> just this one night!”</p>

<p>I have given you twenty-eight—nay, counting your
possible company-meal—twenty-nine dinners in succession
to little purpose if you cannot collate from previous
receipts one or two for yourself, and be the better for the
practice. I need hardly say that I do not anticipate or
desire slavish adherence to the plan sketched for your day
or week. I <i>have</i> sketched—that is all—not worked out
a sum in which addition or subtraction would materially
affect the sum-total. The framework is, I would fain
hope, symmetrical. I expect you to build thereupon as
convenience or discretion may dictate.</p>

<h2>Touching Saucepans.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> it is true that the finest tools will not impart
skill to the untrained workman, it is equally a matter of
fact that the best artisan is he who cares most jealously
for the quality and condition of his instruments as well as
for the finish of his workmanship.</p>

<p>A visitor once asked permission to witness the operation
of cooking a beefsteak in my kitchen, saying that her
husband had spoken in terms of commendation of those
he had eaten at my table. Like the good wife she was,
she desired to “catch the trick,” whatever it might be,
of preparing them to his liking. I willingly acceded to
her request, and upon her return to the parlor her husband
inquired eagerly: “Did you learn the secret?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the smiling answer. “You must buy me a
gridiron!”</p>

<p>Up to that time, she then explained, fried steaks had
been the rule in her house, and gridirons a thing unheard
or unthought of.</p>

<p>A fried beefsteak being, as I have elsewhere stated, a
culinary solecism, I have, perhaps, selected an extreme
case as the test of my discourse upon the necessity of a
supply of fitting utensils for the proper prosecution of
home-cookery. Mrs. Whitney’s idea of the “art-kitchen,”
so charmingly set forth in “We Girls,” may not be so
chimerical (with limitations) as most practical housewives—practised
in nothing more than in the exercise of patience—are
apt to suppose. They tell us the tale—known
already too sadly well to each of us—of the impossibility
of inducing “girls” who are tractable and
respectful in most things, to accept labor-saving machines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and the thousand-and-one ingenious contrivances for
making cooking easier and even graceful; of the hard
usage to which expensive implements are subjected in
rude hands, the motive-power of which is the untilled
brain, unrestrained by the conscienceless will; of how
innovations are openly flouted, or secretly sneered at,
“until,” say they, “we find it easier to let the cook have
her own way down-stairs, and reconcile ourselves, as best
we may, to obstinate stupidity and unmerciful breakages.
As to art-kitchens”—a shrug and a groan,—“we are thankful
if our tenderest care can keep the upper stories free
from the vandalism that rages below.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, acknowledging, as I have, personally, reasons
for doing—the truth of all these things—I make answer,
“Have an art-kitchen for yourself!” First, give your
cook, or maid-of-all-work, a fair trial. It is a duty you owe
to humanity and to her to prove, conclusively, whether her
careless or destructive habits be ingrain and wilful, or
merely the result of ignorance and bad training. There are
bad mistresses, let us remember,—and more still who are
indifferent or incompetent. If “our girl” has a heart or a
conscience, let us find it. Make her understand the value
and usefulness of the appliances you have furnished for
her work, where and how they are to be kept, and set her
the example of always looking for and putting them in
their proper places. If they are misused, show your regret
decidedly, but still kindly. Should all means of
civilizing her taste up to your standard fail, make, as I
have advised, an art-kitchen for your own use. Appropriate
one corner of the room, where cooking is done, for
your operations, and arrange there your pet tools. Have
your scoop flour-sifter; your patent pie-lifter and oyster-broiler;
your star-toaster; your pie-crimper, vegetable and
nutmeg graters; gravy-strainer, colander, biscuit-cutter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
skimmers, larding needles, wire, and perforated, and slit and
fluted spoons; your weights and measures, and the tidy,
serviceable tinned and enamelled saucepans, Scotch kettles,
frying-pans, etc., that will retain tidiness and serviceable
qualities so long in your care, and so soon come to grief
in boorish clutches. Set all these, and as many others as
you like and can afford to buy—always including the
Dover egg-beater and its “Baby” (made for whipping one
egg to more purpose than one egg, or anything else as
small was ever whipped before)—in array upon walls and
shelves,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and let the logic of daily events prove how far
they will deprive work of the wearing vexations attendant
upon long searches for the right article, and its wrong
condition when found. Make your helpers—one and all—comprehend
that these are your especial property, to
be used—<i>and kept clean</i>—by no one else. Let them be
looked down upon as the toys of a would-be-busy woman
by the superior intellects about you, should they see fit
thus to do, and provide such tools as are suited to coarser
fingers for them to use. The chances are many to one
that your dexterous manipulation of your instruments; the
excellence of the products achieved by yourself and them;
even the attractive neatness of the display and your
corner, will win skeptics, first, to indulgence, then, admiration,
then, to imitation. If you can afford the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>luxury of a pastry or mixing-room, adjoining the kitchen,
so much the better for you and your pious undertaking.
But without regard to what may be the effect upon others,
have your saucepans, of whatever designs and in whatever
quantities you like—taking “saucepan” as a generic
term for every description of mute helpers in the task of
elevating cookery into a fine art, or, at the least, in redeeming
it from the stigma of coarseness and vulgarity.</p>

<p>Have, also, as an indispensable adjunct of saucepans,
appliances for cleansing them. There is nothing inherently
degrading in dish-washing. Provide plenty of
towels and hot water; a mop with a handle and a loop by
which to hang it up when it has been squeezed and shaken
after use; a soap-shaker—a neat wire cup, enclosing
the soap, and furnished with a handle of tinned wire, and
a dish-pan, with a partition running across the middle,
that the soiled articles may be rinsed from grease in one
of the compartments before they are purified thoroughly
in the other. Have, also, at hand a can or box of washing
soda, and a bottle of ammonia for taking off the grease
more effectually; a cake of Indexical silver soap in a cup,
with a brush, for restoring lustre to tins, Britannia or
plated, or silver ware. Thus armed, the cleansing of your
implements will be a matter of brief moment, and your
work in the kitchen be, in no sense, a hindrance to the
stated duties of the day, while your methods and occasional
presence cannot fail to be a refining influence upon
all except the very common and spiritually unclean.
Ladyhood, <i>if thorough</i>, will assert itself, even behind a
scullion’s apron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a><br /><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of lean beef, with a marrow-bone.</li>
<li>½ lb. lean ham (or a ham-bone, if you have it).</li>
<li>1 turnip.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>1 carrot.</li>
<li>¼ of a cabbage.</li>
<li>3 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water—cold, of course.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat very fine, and crack the bones well. Put
these on in a pot with a close top; cover with a quart of
water, and set where they will come <i>very slowly</i> to a boil.
If they do not reach this point in less than an hour, so
much the better. When the contents of the pot begin
to bubble, add the remaining two quarts of cold water,
and let all boil slowly for three hours: for two hours with
the top closed, during the last with it slightly lifted.
Wash and peel the turnip, carrot, and onion, scrape the
celery, and wash with the cabbage. Cut all into dice and
lay in cold water, a little salted, for half an hour. Put the
carrot on to stew in a small vessel by itself; the others
all together, with enough water to cover them. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
think the carrot keeps color and shape better if hot,
instead of cold water be used for it. Let it stew until
tender, then drain off the water and set it aside to cool.
The other vegetables should be boiled to pieces. Half
an hour before the soup is to be taken up, strain the water
from the cabbage, etc., pressing them to a pulp to extract
all the strength. Return this to the saucepan, throw in a
little salt, let it boil up once to clear it; skim and add to
the soup. Put in pepper, and salt—unless the ham has
salted it sufficiently—and boil, covered, twenty minutes.
Strain into an earthenware basin; let it get cool enough
for the fat to arise to the surface, when take off all
that will come away. Return to the pot, which should
have been previously rinsed with hot water, boil briskly
for one minute, and throw in the carrot. Skim and serve.</p>

<p>This is a good, clear soup. If you like it thicker, dissolve
a tablespoonful of gelatine in enough cold water to
cover it well—this may be done by an hour’s soaking—and
add to the soup after the latter is strained and cleared
of the fat.</p>

<p>When practicable, make Sunday’s soup on Saturday,
so far as to prepare the “stock,” or meat base. Set it
away in an earthenware crock, adding a little salt. This
not only lessens Sunday’s work, but the unstrained soup
gathers the whole strength of the meat, and the fat can be
removed in a solid cake of excellent dripping. Indeed,
it is a good rule <i>always to prepare soup stock at least
twenty-four hours before it is to be used for the table</i>.</p>

<p>Try, likewise, to make enough soup for Sunday to last
over Monday as well. A little forethought on Saturday
will lessen the labors and increase the comfort of what has
been somewhat profanely named “Job’s birthday,” the anniversary
which was to be accursed for evermore.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken smothered with Oysters.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 full-grown, tender chicken.</li>
<li>1 pint of oysters.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of cream.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of corn-starch.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Yolks of three hard-boiled eggs.</li>
<li>1 scant cup bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and chopped parsley.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prepare the chicken as for roasting. Stuff with a dressing
of the oysters chopped pretty fine, and mixed with the
bread-crumbs, seasoned to taste with pepper and salt.
Tie up the neck securely. (This can be done on Saturday,
if the fowl be afterwards kept in a very cold place.)</p>

<p>Put the chicken thus stuffed and trussed, with legs and
wings tied close to the body with soft tape, into a tin pail
with a <i>tight</i> top. Cover closely and set, with a weight on
the top, in a pot of cold water. Bring gradually to a boil,
that the fowl may be heated evenly and thoroughly. Stew
steadily, never fast, for an hour and a half after the water
in the outer kettle begins to boil. Then open the pail
and test with a fork to see if the chicken be tender. If
not, re-cover <i>at once</i>, and stew for half or three-quarters
of an hour longer. When the chicken is tender throughout,
take it out and lay upon a hot dish, covering immediately.
Turn the juices left in the pail into a saucepan,
thicken with the corn-starch, which should first be wet up
with a little cold milk, then the chopped parsley, butter,
pepper and salt, and the yolks of the hard-boiled eggs
chopped fine. Boil up once, stir in the cream, and take
from the fire before it can boil again. Pour a few spoonfuls
over the chicken, and serve the rest in a sauce-tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Celery Salad.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 bunches of celery.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of salad oil.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.</li>
<li>1 small teaspoonful fine sugar.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash and scrape the celery, lay in ice-cold water until
dinner-time, when cut into inch-lengths, season, tossing
all well up together, and serve in a salad bowl.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower</span> <i>au gratin</i>.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 large cauliflower.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls grated cheese.</li>
<li>1 cup drawn butter.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>A pinch of nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Boil the cauliflower until tender (about twenty minutes),
having first tied it up in a bag of coarse lace or tarlatan.
Have ready a cup of good drawn butter, and pour over
the cauliflower, when you have drained and dished the
latter. Sift the cheese thickly over the top, and brown by
holding a red-hot shovel so close to the cheese that it
singes and blazes. Blow out the fire on the instant, and
send to the table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare the potatoes very thin, lay in cold water for an
hour, and cover well with boiling water. (“Peach-blows”
are better put down in <i>cold</i> water.) Boil quickly, and
when done, drain off every drop of water; throw in a little
salt; set back on the range for two or three minutes.
Mash soft with a potato-beetle, or whip to a cream with a
fork, adding a little butter and enough milk to make a
soft paste. Heap in a smooth mound upon a vegetable
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of tomatoes an hour before cooking them.
Leave out the cores and unripe parts. Cook always in
tin or porcelain saucepans. Iron injures color and flavor.
Stew gently for half an hour; season to taste with salt,
pepper, a little sugar, and a tablespoonful of butter.
Cook gently, uncovered, ten minutes longer, and turn
into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Blanc Mange.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 liberal quart of milk.</li>
<li>1 oz. Cooper’s gelatine.</li>
<li>¾ of a cup of white sugar.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the gelatine for two hours in a breakfast-cup of
cold water. Heat the milk to boiling in a farina-kettle,
or in a tin pail set in a pot of hot water. Add the soaked
gelatine and sugar, stir for ten minutes over the fire, and
strain through a thin muslin bag into a mould wet with
cold water. Flavor and set in a cold place to form. To
loosen it, dip the mould for one instant in hot water, detach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the surface from the sides by a light pressure of the
fingers, and reverse over a glass or china dish. Serve
with powdered sugar and cream.</p>

<p>By all means have Sunday desserts prepared upon the
preceding day. To this end, I have endeavored to give
such receipts for the blessed day as can be easily made
ready on Saturday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoa.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 tablespoonfuls of cocoa to each pint of water.</li>
<li>As much milk as you have water.</li>
<li>Sugar to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the cocoa smooth in a little cold water. Have
ready on the fire the pint of boiling water. Stir in the
grated cocoa-paste. Boil twenty minutes; add the milk
and boil five minutes more, stirring often.</p>

<p>Sweeten in the cups to suit different tastes.</p>

<p>There is a preparation of cocoa, already powdered,
called “cocoatina,” which needs no boiling. It is very
good, and saves the trouble of grating and cooking. I
regret that, although I have used it frequently and with
great satisfaction, I have forgotten the name of the manufacturer.
It is put up in round boxes, like mustard, and
is quite as economical for family use as the cakes of
cocoa.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sponge Cake.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>The weight of the eggs in sugar.</li>
<li>Half their weight in flour.</li>
<li>1 lemon, juice and rind.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat yolks and whites very light, separately of course,
the powdered sugar into the yolks when they are smooth
and thick; next, the juice and grated peel of the lemon;
then the whites with a few swift strokes; at last, the
flour, in great, loose handfuls. Stir in lightly, but thoroughly.
Too much beating after the flour goes in makes
sponge cake tough. Bake in round tin moulds, buttered.
Your oven should be steady. When the cakes begin to
color on top, cover with paper to prevent burning.</p>

<p>When cool, wrap in a thick cloth to keep fresh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Said an irascible householder to a friend from another
city, whom he chanced to meet in the street one day,
“Come and dine with me! But I give you warning we
shall have nothing for dinner but a confounded dressmaker!”
Few of the great middle class, who are the
strength and glory of our land, would dare take an unexpected
guest home on washing-day, although fewer still
would dare reveal, as frankly as did our blunt citizen, the
cause of their reluctance to unveil the penetralia of what
are, upon all days save Black Monday and Blue Tuesday,
orderly and brightsome households.</p>

<p>Don’t interrupt me, please, my much-tried and much-trying
sister, upon whose brow the plaits of Monday’s
tribulations have left enduring traces! I know Bridget
is always cross on wash-day, and that Katy wears an aggrieved
air from morning until night; that dusting, china-washing,
and divers other unaccustomed tasks are appointed
unto your already busy self; that John and the
boys hate “pick-up dinners;” that the modest bills of
fare set down in this book for the second and third days
of the week will, at the first glance, seem preposterous
and unfeeling. You will survey them with very much
the same feeling as moved Pope to exclaim, with tears in
his eyes, “From an old friend I had not expected this!”
when his host, having allowed him to eat to repletion of
less savory viands, had brought on, without a note of
preparation, the poet’s favorite dish, a fine hare roasted
with truffles. But the fact remains that people cannot
swallow enough on Sunday to support Nature through the
two days’ journey into the wilderness of making-clean that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
follows the season of rest and devotion. It is also true
that your husband and yourself, with school-children and
servants, work harder on Monday than upon any other one
day of the seven, and that your food should be nourishing.
Should Bridget protest against “hot mate and soup” as
unprecedented and “onfaling,” Bridget’s mistress (by
courtesy) must bring another unknown commodity to
the obstinate Celt, to bear upon the subject—to wit,
<span class="smcap">Brains</span>. As I shall try to show, an hour given by yourself
to the lower regions—too often an inferno on that
direful day—will put such a repast before unexpectant
John as shall have for his eye and taste none of the characteristics
of a “pick-up dinner.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soup À l’Italienne.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>The stock of Sunday’s soup strained from the carrots.</li>
<li>Half a cup of grated cheese and a cup of milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch wet up with water.</li>
<li>2 eggs beaten light.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the soup on fifteen minutes before dinner, where
it will heat quickly. The moment it boils, draw it to one
side, stir in the corn-starch and milk and heat anew, stirring
constantly until it begins to thicken. Set it again
upon the side of the range, and add the beaten eggs.
Cover and leave it where it will keep hot, but not cook,
while you scald the tureen and put the grated cheese in
the bottom. In five minutes pour the soup upon the
cheese, stir all up well, and it is ready for the table.</p>

<p>This is a delicious soup and easily made.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breaded Mutton Chops—Baked.</span></h3>

<p>Trim the chops neatly and put aside the bones and bits
of skin for the sauce for macaroni. Pour a little melted
butter over the meat. Do this as early in the day as
convenient, cover them and let them stand until an hour
before they are to be served. Then, roll each in beaten
egg, next, in fine cracker-dust, (you can buy it ready
powdered) and lay them in your dripping-pan with a
very little water in the bottom—just enough to keep them
from burning. Bake quickly—covering the dripping-pan
with another—for half an hour. Then remove the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>,
baste the chops with butter and hot water, and let them
brown. When done, lay them upon a hot dish and set
in the open oven to keep warm. Add to the gravy
in the dripping-pan a little hot water, a teaspoonful of
browned flour, a tablespoonful of catsup, a <i>small</i> quantity
of minced onion, pepper and salt. Boil up once,
strain, and pour over the chops.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni with Tomato Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Break the macaroni into short pieces and set over the
fire with enough boiling water to cover it well, as it
swells to treble its original dimensions. In twenty minutes
it should be tender. Drain off the water carefully,
not to break the macaroni, and stir lightly into it pepper,
salt, and a tablespoonful of butter. Turn it into a deep
dish and pour over it a sauce made as follows: To the
bones and refuse bits left from trimming the chops, add a
pint of cold water, and stew slowly upon the back of the
range, (lest Bridget should be inconvenienced thereby,)
until you have less than a cupful of good gravy. Strain
out the bones, etc., season to taste, and add what was left
from the stewed tomatoes of yesterday. Having had the
provision for to-day’s dinner in mind, you will have acted
wisely in seeing for yourself that it did not go into the
swill-pail under the head of “scraps.” Cook tomatoes
and gravy together for three minutes after they begin to
simmer, and pour, smoking hot, over the macaroni. Let
it stand covered a few minutes before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Puff.</span></h3>

<p>To two cupfuls of cold mashed potato (more of yesterday’s
leavings), add a tablespoonful of melted butter, and
beat to a cream. Put with this two eggs whipped light,
and a cupful of milk, salting to taste. Beat all well; pour
into a greased baking-dish, and bake quickly to a light
brown. Serve in the dish in which it was cooked.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-starch Hasty Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of fresh milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch wet up with water.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Heat the milk to scalding, and stir into it the corn-starch
until it has boiled ten minutes and is thick and
smooth throughout. Add salt and butter, let the pudding
stand in the farina-kettle in which it has been boiled—the
hot water around it—for three minutes before turning
it into a deep <i>open</i> dish.</p>

<p>Eat with butter and sugar, or with powdered sugar and
cream, with nutmeg grated over it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee.</span></h3>

<p>A French coffee-pot is a convenience on Monday. If
you have one, you know how to use it. If not, put a
quart of boiling water into your coffee-pot; wet up a cupful
of ground coffee with the white of an egg, adding the
egg-shell, and a little cold water. Put this into the boiling
hot water, and boil fast ten minutes. Then, add half a
cup of cold water, and set it upon the hearth or table to
“settle” for five minutes. Pour it off carefully into your
metal or china coffee-pot or urn.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scotch Broth.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of veal and bones from neck or knuckle.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>1 turnip.</li>
<li>3 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>1 cupful pearl barley.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Crack the bones and mince the meat early in the day,
if you dine near midday, and put on with the cold water.
Soak the barley in lukewarm water, after washing it well,
and when it has lain in the tepid bath for two hours, put
it in the same over the fire to cook slowly, keeping it
covered fully by adding hot water from the kettle. Wash,
scrape and chop the vegetables; cover with cold water,
and stew in a saucepan by themselves. When they are
very soft, rub them through a colander; add the water
in which they were cooked, and keep hot until the meat
in the soup-kettle has boiled to rags. For this purpose
four hours are better than three. Strain out bones and
meat; put soup-stock, barley (with the water in which it
has boiled), vegetable broth, pepper, and salt, into one
kettle and boil slowly for thirty minutes. A little chopped
parsley is an improvement.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rolled Beefsteaks.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 good sirloin steaks.</li>
<li>Bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>A slice of fat salt pork.</li>
<li>Seasoning, a little minced onion, pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take out the bones from the steak and throw them
into the soup-pot. If your butcher has not already done
so, beat the meat flat with the broad side of a hatchet,
and cover it with a force-meat made of bread-crumbs,
minced pork, and half an onion. Moisten this slightly
with water, and season to taste. Roll each steak up,
closely enclosing the stuffing; bind with twine into two compact
bundles and lay in a dripping-pan. Dash a cupful of
boiling water over each, cover with an inverted pan, and
bake about three-quarters of an hour, in their own steam.
At the end of this time remove the cover, baste with
butter and dredge with flour to brown the meat. When
they are of a fine color, lay upon a hot dish. Thicken
the gravy with a little browned flour, boil up and send to
table in a boat. In removing the strings from the rolled
beef prior to serving, clip them in several places, that the
form of the meat may not be disturbed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cabbage Salad.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 small head of cabbage, chopped fine, or cut into shreds.</li>
<li>1 cup of boiling milk.</li>
<li>¾ of a cup of vinegar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of white sugar.</li>
<li>2 eggs well beaten.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful essence of celery.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat milk and vinegar in separate vessels. To the
boiling vinegar add butter, sugar, and seasoning, lastly
the chopped cabbage. Heat to scalding, but do not let
it boil. Stir the beaten eggs into the hot milk. Cook
one minute together after they begin to boil. Turn the
hot cabbage into a bowl; pour the custard over it; toss
up and about with a wooden or silver fork, until all the
ingredients are well mixed. Cover and set in a very cold
place for some hours.</p>

<p>This is a very delightful salad, quite repaying the
trouble of cooking the dressing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Browned Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil large potatoes with their skins on; peel them, and,
when you uncover your beef for browning, lay the potatoes
in the dripping-pan about the meat. Dredge and
baste them as well as the beef. If not quite brown when
the meat is ready, leave them in the gravy for awhile,
before thickening the latter. Drain in a hot colander,
and arrange neatly around the steaks in the dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Soak dried beans all night in soft water, exchanging
this in the morning for lukewarm, and this, two hours
later, for still warmer. Let them lie an hour in this,
before putting them on to boil in cold water. When
they are soft, drain and turn them into a bake-dish. Season
with pepper and salt, with a liberal spoonful of butter.
Add enough boiling water to prevent them from scorching
and bake, covered, until they smoke and bubble. Remove
the cover, and brown. Serve in the bake-dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple and Tapioca Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 teacupful tapioca, soaked for five hours in 3 teacupfuls of warm (not hot) water.</li>
<li>8 juicy pippins, pared and cored.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of sugar and a saltspoonful of salt, with a few whole cloves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Arrange the apples in a deep dish; add a cup of cold
water; cover, and steam in a moderate oven until tender
all through, turning them once or twice. Turn off half
the liquid and pour the tapioca, which should have been
soaked in a warm place, over the apples, when you have
filled the hollows left by the cores with sugar and put a
clove in each. The tapioca should be <i>slightly</i> salted.
Bake one hour, or until the tapioca is clear and crusted
on top. Serve in pudding-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hard Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>To two cups of powdered sugar add half a cup of butter,
slightly warmed, so that the two can be worked up
together. When they are well mixed, beat in half a teaspoonful
of nutmeg and the juice of a lemon. Whip
smooth and light, mound neatly upon a butter-plate, and
set in the cold to harden.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Split Pea Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pint of split peas.</li>
<li>4 quarts of water.</li>
<li>2 lbs. of beef and some bones.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>¼ lb. of lean bacon or ham.</li>
<li>3 stalks of celery, the white part only, cut fine.</li>
<li>Juice of a lemon.</li>
<li>Stale bread cut into dice and fried.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the peas all night in soft water, changing it in the
morning for warm—not hot. Throw this off after an hour
and cover the peas with four quarts of cold water. Boil in
this—adding the meat, cut small, the bones well cracked
and the celery—four hours. <i>Always boil soups slowly.</i>
The neglect of this rule leaves in the kettle a mass of
toughened meat and an ocean of dish-water.</p>

<p>When you are ready to take up your soup, strain in a
colander, picking out and casting aside bits of bones and
shreds of meat. Rub the peas and celery through the
holes of the strainer until nothing more will pass. Season
with pepper and salt; add the juice of a small lemon, and
return to the kettle, which must first be rinsed with hot
water. Let all boil together two minutes. Should it not
seem so thick as you would like, you can put in, while it
is boiling, a little corn-starch wet up with cold water.
Put a couple of slices of stale bread, cut into dice and
fried crisp in dripping, in the heated tureen, and pour the
soup upon them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Halibut Steaks—Fried.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and wipe the steaks. Roll each in flour, and fry
upon a buttered griddle, turning carefully with a spatula,
or cake-turner, when the lower side is done. They should
be of a nice brown, and tender throughout. Remove to a
hot dish and garnish with sliced lemon; in carving, see
that a bit of the lemon goes to each person, as many prefer
it to any other sauce for fish. Send around potatoes
with the steak. Worcestershire is a good store-sauce for
fish and game. Anchovy is pre-eminently a fish sauce, but
many do not like it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Leg of Mutton—Boiled.</span></h3>

<p>Do not have the mutton too fat or too large. Cut off
the shank, which the butcher will have nicked for you,
leaving about two inches beyond the ham. Wash and
wipe carefully and boil in hot water, with a little salt, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
a fork will readily pierce the thickest part. About ten or
twelve minutes to the pound is a good rule in boiling <i>fresh</i>
meat. Serve with caper sauce. Since you intend to use
the liquor in which the meat is boiled for to-morrow’s soup,
do not oversalt it. But sprinkle, instead, salt over the leg
of mutton after it is dished; rub it all over with butter and
set in a hot oven for a single minute.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Caper Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of the liquor in which the meat has been boiled.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of flour rubbed smooth in a little water. Salt to taste.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>About two dozen capers or green nasturtium-seed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the liquor to boiling, and skim before stirring in
the flour, which must be perfectly free from lumps, and
rubbed smooth in cold water. Stir until the sauce thickens
evenly. It is best to cook all sauces in a vessel set within
a larger one of hot water. When it has boiled about a
minute, add the butter gradually, stirring each bit in well
before putting in more. Salt, and drop in the capers.
Let it just boil, and turn into a sauce-boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach.</span></h3>

<p>Pull the spinach from the stalks, leaf by leaf; wash carefully,
and leave in cold water one hour. Boil in hot water
fifteen minutes. Drain very dry in a colander; chop extremely
fine in a wooden bowl, then return to the saucepan
with a tablespoonful of butter, a little salt, and a teaspoonful
of white sugar. As it heats beat it up with a wooden
spoon until it is a soft paste. Let it bubble up once, and
dish. Lay a hard-boiled egg or two, cut in thin slices,
upon the surface. Few vegetables are more often ruined
in the cooking than spinach. The above receipt is simple
and good.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and cut into large dice some good potatoes. Lay
in cold water half an hour. Stew in cold water, a little
salted. There should be enough water to cover them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
well. When they are tender and begin to crumble at the
edges, drain off half the water, and pour in as much milk.
When they are again scalding hot, stir in a lump of butter
the size of an egg (for a large dish) rolled in flour, salt,
pepper and chopped parsley to taste. Boil up once and
serve in a covered dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cottage Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>1 cup of sweet milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>2 eggs, beaten light, yolks and whites separately.</li>
<li>Saltspoonful of salt.</li>
<li><i>About</i> 3 cups of Hecker’s prepared flour, enough for cake-batter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the butter well into the sugar; add beaten yolks;
the milk, salt, then whipped whites and yolks alternately.
Bake in a buttered mould. When you can bring out the
testing-straw clean from the middle of the loaf, turn it
out upon a dish. Cut in slices while hot, as it is wanted.</p>

<p>One who has never tried it can hardly believe that the
result of a receipt which may be tried fearlessly by a
novice in cookery, could be the really elegant pudding
just described.</p>

<p>It is also as economical as toothsome.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sauce for Cottage Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>1 cup of boiling water.</li>
<li>1 glass sherry wine.</li>
<li>Nutmeg or cinnamon to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the butter into the sugar; add hot water gradually;
then spice and wine. Cover tightly to keep in the
strength of the wine, and set for twenty minutes in a
saucepan of boiling water. Stir up and send to table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Vermicelli Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take off all the fat from the broth in which your mutton
was cooked yesterday, and boil it down slowly to two-thirds
of the original quantity. Stew to pieces, in another
vessel, a stalk of celery, one small onion, a carrot, and a
bunch of sweet herbs—all cut up fine. A ham-bone, if
you have it, or a couple of slices of lean ham, will be an
improvement to the broth. Strain the soup; rub the
vegetables through a fine colander with the water in
which they were boiled; return to the fire with a double
handful of vermicelli broken into short pieces; boil for
ten minutes; add a tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour;
boil up and serve.</p>

<p>Send around a saucer of grated cheese with vermicelli
and macaroni soups. It is a great improvement to the
flavor and consistency. Each person may take as much
or as little as he likes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Oysters.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of fine oysters.</li>
<li>1 coffee-cupful of pounded cracker.</li>
<li>2 great spoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>½ cupful of cream or rich milk.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Butter a baking-dish and cover the bottom pretty
thickly with pounded cracker. Wet with oyster liquor
and a few spoonfuls of cream. Next, lay oysters, one
deep, closely over these. Pepper and salt, and stick a
bit of butter upon each. Another layer of crumbs, wet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
as before; more oysters, and proceed in like order until
your dish is full, making the top layer of crumbs with
butter dotted over it. Set in the oven, invert a plate or
tin pan over the dish, and bake until the juice bubbles up
to the top. Uncover; set upon the upper grating of the
oven to brown, and send to table in the bake-dish. Pass
around sliced lemon with it.</p>

<p>Oysters, like fish, follow immediately after soup, and
are a course by themselves.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mince of Mutton with Potato Frill.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>The remains of yesterday’s mutton, minced, but not very fine.</li>
<li>1 cupful of drawn butter.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of cream, or rich milk.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and mace to taste, also chopped parsley.</li>
<li>1 button onion.</li>
<li>2 eggs, well beaten.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the sauce to a boil, add the seasoning and the
onion, chopped very fine; then, the meat. Draw the
saucepan to the side of the range, and let it stand,
closely covered, in <i>boiling</i> water for ten minutes. Set
again over the fire and bring to boiling point. Add the
eggs and milk and set back at the side for five minutes,
still covered. The mince should never really boil after
the meat goes in.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Frill.</span></h3>

<p>Boil and mash some potatoes; working in a little milk
and butter, but not so much as to make the paste very
soft. Season with salt, and, while still hot, knead in a
beaten egg. Shape this paste into a fence, on the inside
round of a shallow dish; fluting it regularly with the round
handle of a knife. Set for one minute in a hot oven, but
not long enough to cause the fence to crack. Glaze
quickly with butter, and pour the meat carefully within
the wall. The mince should not be so thin as to wash
away the “frill.” If well managed this is a pretty and a
savory dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 can of tomatoes.</li>
<li>Stale bread, crumbed fine.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, a little chopped parsley, and white sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drain off two-thirds of the liquor from the tomatoes;
salt it and set aside for another day’s soup. One has no
excuse for waste whose “stock-pot” is always near at
hand. Little comes amiss to it. Cover the bottom of a
bake-dish with crumbs; lay the tomatoes evenly upon this
bed; season with pepper, salt, sugar, and parsley, with
bits of butter here and there. Strew bread-crumbs over
all, a thicker layer than at the bottom; put tiny pieces of
butter upon this, and bake, covered, about thirty-five minutes.
Take off the cover and brown upon the upper shelf
of the oven. Do not let it stay there long enough to get
dry.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Celery—Raw.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, trim, and scrape the stalks, selecting those that
are white and tender. Crisp by leaving them in very cold
water until they are wanted for the table. Arrange neatly
in a celery-stand. Pass between the oysters and meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tipsy Trifle.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>3 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
<li>1 stale sponge-cake.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>Flavoring of vanilla.</li>
<li>1 cup of sherry wine.</li>
<li>A few spoonfuls of currant jelly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make a custard of the milk, sugar, the yolks of the eggs
and the whites of <i>two</i>. Put in the latter ingredients
when the milk <i>almost</i> boils, and stir until it begins to
thicken. Flavor when cold. Put a layer of sliced cake
in the bottom of a glass bowl. Wet with the wine and a
few spoonfuls of custard, and when it is quite soaked, put
on more cake. Proceed in this manner until the cake
and wine are used up, when pour on, a little at a time, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
remainder of the custard; holding down the cake with a
bread spoon as you do this to keep it from floating. Lay
a heavy plate upon it, for the same purpose, while you prepare
a méringue by whipping stiff the rest of the whites,
and then beating in the currant jelly. Cover the trifle
with this just before dinner-time.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apples and Nuts.</span></h3>

<p>Polish the apples, and crack the nuts, unless you have
plenty of nut-crackers. Give a knife to each apple-plate,
and teach the children to pare them neatly for themselves,
instead of “munching” like rabbits at family dinners, and
being awkwardly ill at ease when “company” is present.
Silver or ivory knives are better for fruit than steel.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Soupe Maigre.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>3 pints of water.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>1 turnip.</li>
<li>3 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>1 potato (large).</li>
<li>Quarter of a small cabbage, sliced.</li>
<li>½ cup of bread-crumbs, very dry.</li>
<li>2 eggs, beaten light.</li>
<li>Parsley, pepper, and salt to taste.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Clean, scrape, and mince the vegetables, and put on to
cook in cold water, enough to cover them well. When
they are scalding hot, drain, and cover them with three
pints of boiling water. Stew slowly in this until they are
reduced to pulp. Rub through a colander, season, and
heat again to boiling. Stir in the bread-crumbs; then the
butter, very gradually. Have the milk ready, heated in
another vessel, and pour into the soup-kettle at this juncture.
Let the soup get very hot, but not boil. Set upon
the side of the range, and, dipping out a cupful, add it, a
little at a time, to the beaten eggs. When well mixed,
return eggs and liquor to the rest of the soup; stir over the
fire for an instant, but never to boiling, and serve in a hot
tureen.</p>

<p>The eggs should not be allowed to curdle in the liquor;
hence the need of carefulness in following the directions
above given. A little grated cheese is a pleasant accompaniment
to this soup, each person adding it as pleases
him.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Cod.</span></h3>

<p>Lay the fish in cold water, a little salt, for half an hour.
Wipe dry, and sew up in a linen cloth, coarse and clean,
fitted to the shape of the piece of cod. Have but one fold
over each part. Lay in the fish-kettle, cover with boiling
water, salted at discretion. Allow nearly an hour for a
piece weighing four pounds.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>To one gill of boiling water allow as much milk; stir
into this, while boiling, two tablespoonfuls of butter,
added gradually, a tablespoonful of flour wet up with cold
water, and, as it thickens, the chopped yolk of a boiled
egg and one raw egg, beaten light. Take directly from
the fire, season with pepper, salt, a little chopped parsley
and the juice of a lemon, and set, covered, in boiling water,
but not over the fire, for five minutes, stirring occasionally.
Pour part of the sauce over the fish when dished;
the rest in a boat. Send around mashed potatoes with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Duck.</span></h3>

<p>Clean the duck very carefully, rinsing it out with a
little soda and water, and afterwards with fresh water. Lay
in cold, salted water for an hour. Wipe dry, inside and
out, and stuff with a dressing of bread-crumbs, seasoned
with pepper and salt, a <i>very</i> little powdered sage and a
“suspicion” of minced onion. Sew up; dash a cup of
boiling water over them, as they lie in the dripping-pan,
and roast, covered, for the first half-hour. Remove the
cover, and baste freely—three times with butter and
water, four or five times with the gravy from the pan.
Stew the giblets in a little salted water, and reserve to
piece out to-morrow’s salmi. Dish the ducks upon a hot
platter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bread Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Skim the fat well from the gravy left in the dripping-pan;
have ready a handful of bread-crumbs (stale), wet
up with hot water. Thicken the gravy with these when
it has come to a boil; season with pepper, salt, and a
pinch of mace. Boil all together once and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>See receipt for <i>Sunday</i>.</p>

<p>While I would spare you all waste of time and pains
in looking up receipts in other parts of this volume, I yet
deem it hardly worth while to write out in full the same
directions twice for the same week—or month.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Croquettes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of cold boiled rice.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of sugar, and half as much salt.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of melted butter.</li>
<li>1 egg, beaten light.</li>
<li>Enough milk to make the rice into stiff paste.</li>
<li>Sweet lard for frying.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work rice, butter, egg, etc., into an adhesive paste, beating
each ingredient thoroughly into the mixture. Flour
your hands and make the rice into oval balls. Dip each
in beaten egg, then in flour, or cracker-dust, and fry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in boiling lard, a few at a time, turning each with great
care. When the croquettes are of a fine yellow-brown,
take out with a wire spoon and lay within a heated colander
to drain off every drop of fat. Serve hot, with
sprigs of parsley laid about them, in an uncovered dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Celery.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the celery into inch lengths; cover with cold
water and stew until tender. Turn off the water and supply
its place with enough milk to cover the celery. When
this begins to boil stir in a good lump of butter rolled in
flour; pepper and salt to taste, and stew gently five minutes.</p>

<p>You will like this vegetable thus prepared. Eat, if
you like, with a little lemon-juice or vinegar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Pie.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of flour, dried and sifted.</li>
<li>½ lb. of lard.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of butter.</li>
<li>Ice-water to make stiff paste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the lard into the dry flour. Wet with ice-water
into stiff paste, touching as little as may be with your
hands. Roll out very thin, always <i>from</i> you. Stick bits
of butter all over the sheet; roll up tightly as you would
a sheet of paper. Beat flat with your rolling-pin, roll
out again, and again baste with butter. Repeat the
operations of rolling up, rolling out, and basting until
your butter is used up. Set the roll of pastry in a cold,
dry place for at least one hour. All night would not be
too long. When it is crisp and firm, roll out and line your
buttered pie-plates. The bottom crust should be thinner
than the upper. And, as a rule, you would do well to
give the roll of pastry intended for the latter a “baste”
or two more than that meant for the lower.</p>

<p>Pare, core and slice juicy, tart apples; put a layer
upon the inner crust, sprinkle with sugar thickly—scatter
a few cloves upon the sugar; then another layer of apples,
and so on, until the dish is full. Cover with crust,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
pressed down firmly at the edges, and bake. Eat warm,
or cold, with white sugar sifted over the top.</p>

<p>Apple pie is very good with cream poured over each
slice.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>3 lbs. of coarse, lean beef, cut into thin strips.</li>
<li>2 or 3 lbs. of bones, broken small.</li>
<li>4 onions, sliced.</li>
<li>1 bunch of sweet herbs, chopped.</li>
<li>Tomato juice or catsup.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of macaroni.</li>
<li>A few salt pork bones.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fry the meat until half done, in a very little dripping.
Take it out and fry the onions and bones in the same
gravy. Put all into a soup-kettle with the herbs, and
cover with 4 quarts of water (cold). Bring to a slow
boil, and, at the end of four hours, strain into a great
bowl to cool, in order that the fat may rise and be taken
off. Meanwhile, make ready your macaroni by breaking
it into short bits, covering well with boiling water, a
little salted, and stewing slowly twenty minutes, or until
tender. Add a lump of butter the size of a walnut; let
it stand, covered, for a few minutes, while you season
the soup, adding the tomato-juice or catsup. Boil, skim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and thicken with a tablespoonful of corn-starch wet up
with cold water. When it is again on the boil, turn in
the macaroni, taking care not to break it. Heat to
scalding, but do not boil; pour out, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ham and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Cut your slices of ham of a uniform size and shape,
cutting off the rind. Fry quickly in their own fat. Remove
from the pan with a wire spoon so soon as they are
done, and arrange upon a hot dish, setting this within the
open oven, or upon a pot of boiling water to keep warm.
Drop the eggs, as you break them, into the hot fat left
in the frying-pan. Do not put so many in as to crowd
one another. Each egg should preserve its individuality.
Cook about three minutes, without turning. Take up
with a spatula, or cake-turner, and lay one upon each slice
of ham. Do not send the gravy to table. Strain, and use
for dripping.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmi of Duck.</span></h3>

<p>From the cold ducks left after yesterday’s dinner cut
all the meat in as neat slices as you can, leaving the
joints of legs and wings whole. Take off the skin; break
the carcass into pieces, and put these, with the stuffing,
into a saucepan with a fried onion, some sweet herbs,
pepper, salt, and a pinch of allspice. Cover with cold
water and stew gently, after it reaches the boil, for one
hour. Cool, that the fat may rise and be taken off.
Strain the gravy when you have skimmed it; return to
the saucepan, boil and skim again, and stir in two tablespoonfuls
of browned flour, wet with cold water; lastly,
stir in a great spoonful of butter. Stew five minutes longer,
and put in the meat. Draw to one side of the range,
and set, closely covered, in a pot of boiling water for ten
minutes. The meat must be thoroughly heated and
steeped in the gravy, <i>but not boil</i>. Take the meat out
with a perforated spoon, pile neatly upon a dish and pour
the gravy over it. Garnish with triangles of stale bread
fried crisp, and send a piece to each person who is helped
to salmi.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Parsnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, until tender, in hot water slightly salted; let them
get almost cold, scrape off the skin, and cut in thick,
long slices. Dredge with flour and fry in hot dripping,
turning as they brown. Drain very dry in a hot colander;
pepper and salt and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Salsify.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape the roots, dropping each into cold water as you
do this, that they may not change color. Cut in pieces
an inch long; cover with hot water and stew until tender.
Drain off two-thirds of the water and add enough milk to
cover the salsify. Stew ten minutes in this; put in a
good lump of butter rolled thickly in flour. Pepper and
salt. Boil up for one minute.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes—in Jackets.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil in their skins when you have washed them, selecting
such as are of like size. Then put in a moderate
oven and bake until soft all through. You can ascertain
this by pinching the largest. Wipe off and serve in
their skins.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rosie’s Rice Custard.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>3 eggs, well beaten.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>1 cup <i>boiled</i> rice.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
<li>Half the grated rind of a lemon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the rice, drain, and stir, while hot, into the milk.
Beat the eggs well; rub butter and sugar to a cream with
lemon-peel and a little salt, and stir into the warm milk.
Mix well and bake in a buttered dish in a brisk oven.
Eat warm or cold. <i>We</i> like it better warm, with a little
cream poured over it when served in saucers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Soupe au Julienne.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 lbs. of lean beef. If possible, get it from the shin and have the accompanying bones cracked to bits.</li>
<li>6 quarts of water—cold.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prepare the stock on Saturday. Put meat and bones
into a pot with a close cover, pour on the water, and set
it where it will heat very slowly. Boil, also very slowly,
six hours, at the back of the range. Should the water sink
fast in the pot, replenish from the boiling tea-kettle. At
the end of six hours, turn the soup, meat, bones and all,
into an earthenware vessel; pepper and salt it and set on
the cellar floor, covered, until next day. Take off, then,
the cake of excellent dripping from the top; strain the
soup and set over the fire, about an hour before dinner,
and heat gradually.</p>

<p>The vegetables should be—</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>3 turnips.</li>
<li>Half a head of cabbage.</li>
<li>1 pint Shaker corn, soaked overnight.</li>
<li>6 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>1 quart of tomatoes.</li>
<li>1 large onion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clean, scrape, and mince all these, except the corn
and tomatoes. Cut the carrot into dice and stew, by itself,
in a little cold water. Boil the corn in enough water
to cover it, and add more hot water as it swells. Cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the minced vegetables with cold water, and so soon as it
boils, turn it off, and replenish with boiling, from the kettle.
This will take away the rank taste from cabbage and
onion. When they are soft enough to pulp, strain well,
but <i>without pressing</i>, into the soup. It is needless to
add the vegetables, as the strength is in the liquor. Boil
up and skim the soup before putting in the boiled corn
and the canned tomatoes, which should be cut up small,
and the unripe parts removed. Boil fifteen minutes, add
the carrot, season to taste, and serve.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Turkey.</span></h3>

<p>Rinse out the turkey well with soda and water; then
with salt, lastly with fair water. Stuff with a dressing
made of bread-crumbs, wet up with butter and water and
seasoned to your taste. Stuff the craw and tie up the
neck. Fill the body and sew up the vent. I need hardly
say that these strings are to be clipped and removed after
the fowl is roasted. Tie the legs to the lower part of the
body that they may not “sprawl,” as the sinews shrink.
Put into the dripping-pan, pour a teacupful of boiling
water over it, and roast, basting often, allowing about ten
minutes’ time for every pound. Be careful not to have
your oven too hot—especially during the first half-hour or
so. The turkey would, otherwise, be dry and blackened
on the outside and raw within. And remember how
much of the perfection of roasting meats and poultry depends
upon basting faithfully. Boil the giblets tender in
a little water. When the turkey is done, set it where it
will keep warm; skim the gravy left in the pan; add a
little boiling water; thicken slightly with browned flour;
boil up once and add the giblets minced fine. Season to
taste; give another boil, and send to table in a gravy-boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cranberry Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and pick over the cranberries; put on to cook
in a tin or porcelain vessel, allowing a teacupful of water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>to each quart. Stew slowly, stirring often until they are
as thick as marmalade. Take from the fire in little over
an hour, if they have cooked steadily, sweeten plentifully
with white sugar, and strain through coarse tarlatan, or
mosquito-net, into a mould wet with cold water.</p>

<p>Do this on Saturday. On Sunday, turn out into a glass
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes—Browned.</span></h3>

<p>Having mashed them in the usual manner, mound
them smoothly upon a shallow earthenware dish and set
them in a quick oven, glazing them with butter as they
color. They should be of a light brown. Slip the
mound from a coarser to a finer platter by the help of
your cake-turner. It is still better if you have one of
the pretty “enamelled” bake-dishes lined with porcelain,
with silver stands for the table. They are invaluable for
puddings, scallops, etc.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Corn.</span></h3>

<p>Stew one quart of canned corn in its own liquor, setting
the vessel containing it in an outer, of hot water.
Should the corn be exceptionally dry, add a little cold
water. When tender, pour in enough milk to cover the
corn, bring to a boil, and put in a tablespoonful of butter
rolled in flour, and salt to taste. Stew gently, stirring
well, three or four minutes, and turn into a deep dish.
Keep the vessel containing the corn closely covered while
it is cooking. The steam facilitates the process and preserves
the color of the corn.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Celery</span></h3>

<p>Is the usual accompaniment of roast turkey. Prepare
by selecting the blanched stalks, scraping off the rust, cutting
off all but the youngest and tenderest tops, and laying
these in cold water to crisp until wanted for the table.
Garnish your turkey with alternate light and dark green
sprigs of celery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tropical Snow.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>8 sweet oranges.</li>
<li>1 grated cocoanut.</li>
<li>1 glass of pale sherry.</li>
<li>1 cup of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>5 red bananas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Peel and cut the oranges into small pieces by dividing
each lobe crosswise into thirds. Extract the seeds and
put a layer of the fruit in the bottom of a glass dish.
Pour a little wine upon it, and strew with powdered sugar.
The cocoanut must have been prepared by removing the
rind and throwing it into cold water for some time before
grating it. Over the layer of oranges spread one of cocoanut;
cut the bananas into very thin, round slices, and lay
these, one deep, upon the cocoanut. Repeat the order
just given until your dish is full and the oranges and bananas
used up. The top layer must be of cocoanut, heaped
high, sprinkled with powdered sugar and garnished about
the base with slices of banana. Eat soon, as the oranges
toughen in the wine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Supplement this pretty, but not substantial dessert by a
salver of lady’s-fingers, and macaroons, and a good cup of
coffee.</p>

<p>Julienne soup, like most other soups the base of which
is meat, is better when warmed over the second day. Set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
it over the fire where it will heat, not too quickly, <i>almost</i>
to a boil. It will not “put back” the business of the
day twenty minutes, and be a welcome addition to your
dinner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Turkey Scallop.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the meat from yesterday’s turkey. Crack the carcass
to pieces, and put, with bits of skin, fat, and gristle,
into a saucepan; cover with cold water, and set on to stew
slowly into gravy. Chop the meat very fine; strew the
bottom of a greased bake-dish with crumbs, and cover
this with a thick stratum of minced turkey, stuffing, and
tiny bits of butter. Pepper and salt, and put on more
crumbs, then meat, and so on. Stale bread is better for
this scallop than cracker-dust. Having used up all your
meat and reserved enough crumbs for a thick upper crust,
cover the dish and put aside in a cool place until your
gravy is ready. It is economy of time, on Monday, to
slip in such work as this between the many “must be’s”
of the season. Your scallop will be none the worse for
waiting some hours before, or after, the gravy is added,
provided you keep it covered. When the gravy has drawn
all the substance from bones, etc., strain it and return to
the saucepan with what was left in yesterday’s gravy-boat,
having first skimmed the latter. Boil up, thicken with
browned flour wet up with cold water; bring to another
boil; pour over the scallop, saving a little to wet the top.
Now comes your layer of <i>fine</i> bread-crumbs. Wet these
with the gravy in a bowl, season to taste, beat to a soft
paste with a couple of eggs and spread evenly over the
scallop. Invert a plate over the bake-dish and set in the
oven. When, at the end of half an hour or so, the gravy
bubbles up at the sides, remove the cover and brown.
Serve in the pudding-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Panned Oysters.</span></h3>

<p>A four-course dinner is hardly in order in most households
on Monday. You can, if you like, and have an efficient
table-waiter, bring on oysters, as usual, between soup
and meat. But there will be no violation of the “unities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of the drama” of a family dinner, if you send around your
oysters, scallop, and vegetables together.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of oysters.</li>
<li>Some thin slices of toast.</li>
<li>Butter, salt, and pepper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have ready some “patty pans”—the more nearly upright
the sides the better. Cut stale bread in rounds to fit the
bottoms of these. Toast, and lay a piece in each. Wet
with oyster liquor and put into each pan as many oysters
as it will conveniently hold. Pepper and salt; put a bit
of butter upon each; arrange all in a large dripping-pan;
invert another of the same size over it, and bake eight
minutes, or until the oysters “ruffle.” Send hot to table
in the pans.</p>

<p>You can toast the bread at breakfast-time if you choose.
The oysters can go into the oven when the soup is poured
out, and be in good season on the table. By this arrangement
they will not interfere with the other “baked meats.”
Panned oysters are always popular, and there is no more
simple manner of cooking this favorite shell-fish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Choose large, fair potatoes, wash and wipe, and bake
until soft to the grasp. Three-quarters of an hour should
suffice. Take out, before the oysters go in; wipe off dust
and ashes, and serve in a heated napkin. This will keep
them hot a long time, yet prevent them from “sweating.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of tomatoes at least one hour before it is to
be used, and empty into an earthenware basin, that no
close or metallic taste may linger about them. Cook in
tin or porcelain. Stew half an hour, gently; add salt,
pepper, a teaspoonful of sugar, and three of butter, a
handful of dry bread-crumbs—or, if you have any stewed
corn left from yesterday, use that instead of bread. Cook
ten minutes longer, and turn out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Floating Island.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls (great ones) of sugar.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls extract of bitter almond or vanilla. (<span class="smcap">Colgate’s</span> extracts are the best in market, and <i>do not spoil</i> within a few days after they are uncorked, as the manner of some is.)</li>
<li>½ cup of currant jelly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk to scalding, but not boiling. Beat the
yolks, stir into them the sugar, and pour upon them,
gradually and mixing well, a cupful of the hot milk. Return
to the saucepan and boil until it begins to thicken.
You can do this while breakfast is cooking, before the
Moloch clothes-boiler goes on. When cool, flavor and
pour into a glass dish. Heap upon the top a <i>méringue</i>
of the whites whipped until you can cut it, into which
you have beaten the jelly, a teaspoonful at a time.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tea.</span></h3>

<p>“A comfortable cup of tea” never comes amiss to a
fagged housewife, be it served at breakfast, luncheon, or
dinner. The best way to insure its goodness—that is,
that it be strong, hot and fresh—is to have your own tea-urn
or kettle on the table, with a spirit-lamp burning
under it. Scald the tea-pot, put in the tea; cover with
boiling water; put a “cosey” or a thick napkin about it,
and let it stand five minutes before filling with more
<i>boiling</i> water. Wait a minute longer and pour out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Soup with Tapioca.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. perfectly lean mutton. The scrag makes good soup and costs little.</li>
<li>2 or 3 lbs. of bones, well pounded.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>2 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>A few sprigs of parsley. If you have any tomatoes left from yesterday, add them.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of pearl or granulated tapioca (not heaping spoonfuls).</li>
<li>4 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put on the meat, cut in small pieces, with the bones,
in two quarts of cold water. Heat very slowly, and
when it boils pour in two quarts of hot water from the
kettle. Chop the vegetables; cover with cold water. So
soon as they begin to simmer, throw off the first water,
replenishing with hot, and stew until they are boiled to
pieces. The meat should cook steadily, never fast, five
hours, keeping the pot-lid on. Strain into a great bowl;
let it cool to throw the fat to the surface; skim and return
to the fire. Season with pepper and salt, boil up,
take off the scum; add the vegetables with their liquor.
Heat together ten minutes, strain again, and bring to a
slow boil before the tapioca goes in. This should have
been soaked one hour in cold water, then cooked in the
same within another vessel of boiling water until each
grain is clear. It is necessary to stir up often from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
bottom while cooking. Stir gradually into the soup until
the tapioca is dissolved.</p>

<p>Send around grated cheese with this soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmon Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 can preserved salmon.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls melted butter.</li>
<li>½ cup fine bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and minced parsley.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mince the fish, draining off the liquor for the sauce.
Rub in the butter until thoroughly incorporated. Work
in the crumbs, the seasoning, at last the beaten eggs.
Put into a buttered pudding-mould, set in a dripping-pan
full of hot water. Cover the mould, and steam in the
oven, keeping the water in the pan at a fast boil, filling up
as it evaporates, for one hour. Set it in cold water one
minute when you have taken it from the oven. This will
make it shrink from the sides and turn out easily upon a
flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sauce for the above.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cupful of milk heated to a boil and thickened with a tablespoonful of corn-starch, previously wet up with cold water.</li>
<li>The liquor from the salmon.</li>
<li>1 great spoonful of butter.</li>
<li>1 raw egg, beaten light.</li>
<li>Juice of half a lemon.</li>
<li>Mace and cayenne pepper to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the egg into the thickened milk when you have
stirred in the butter and liquor; take from the fire, season,
and let it stand in hot water three minutes, covered.
Lastly, put in the lemon-juice and turn out immediately.
Pour it all over and about the pudding. Cut the latter
into slices when helping it out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak.</span></h3>

<p>First of all, let me recommend the plan of broiling a
steak under, instead of over the grate. I have found so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
many and manifest advantages in the former method that
I have had a gridiron made to fit beneath my range.</p>

<p>Wipe the steak dry, and broil upon a buttered gridiron,
turning frequently, whenever it begins to drip. When
done, which should be in twelve minutes, if your fire is
clear and strong, lay upon a <i>hot</i> dish—a chafing-dish is
best—season with pepper and salt (not until then),
and butter very liberally. Put over it a hot cover, and
wait five minutes before sending to table, to draw the
juices to the surface and allow the seasoning to penetrate
the steak.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Lyonnaise.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil a dozen potatoes at breakfast-time, and set
aside, when you have peeled them, as they should get
perfectly cold. When you are ready to cook them, heat
some butter, or good dripping, in a frying-pan; fry in it
one small onion, chopped fine, until it begins to change
color—say about one minute. Then put in the potatoes,
cut into dice, not too thick or broad. Stir well and cook
five minutes, taking care the potatoes do not break to
pieces. <i>They must not brown.</i> Put in some minced
parsley just before taking them up. Drain dry by shaking
in a heated colander. Serve very hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni with Cheese.</span></h3>

<p>Cook half a pound of pipe macaroni, broken into inch
lengths, in boiling water until tender. Drain this off, and
substitute a cupful of cold milk. When the macaroni has
again come to a boil, season with pepper and salt and stir
in a great spoonful of butter; lastly, two tablespoonfuls
of dry, grated cheese. Turn into a deep dish, strew more
cheese thickly over it, and it is ready for use.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Susie’s Bread Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>3 cups very fine, dry bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of melted butter.</li>
<li>1 teacupful white sugar.</li>
<li>Juice and half the grated peel of a lemon.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Rub butter and sugar together. Beat the yolks of the
four eggs and the white of one very light; mix the butter
and sugar with these. Soak the crumbs in the milk, and
beat in with the other ingredients, hard and fast. Add
the lemon last. Bake in a buttered dish. When nearly
done and fully “set,” even in the middle, spread with a
<i>méringue</i> made of the reserved whites, beaten stiff with
a little sugar. It is good eaten warm—not really hot—or
cold, especially if a little cream be poured over each
saucerful.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bean Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Soak a quart of dried beans all night in soft water.
Throw this off next morning, and cover the beans for two
hours in water a little more than lukewarm. Put over
the fire with five quarts of cold water, and one pound of
salt pork. A bone of veal or beef may be added, if you
have it. Boil slowly for at least four hours; shred into
it a small onion, four stalks of celery, pepper—the pork
<i>may</i> salt it sufficiently—simmer half an hour longer, rub
through a colander until only husks and fibres remain, and
send to table. Pass sliced lemon with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fillet of Veal—Stuffed.</span></h3>

<p>Make ready a force-meat of bread-crumbs, chopped
thyme and parsley; pepper, salt, and a pinch of nutmeg;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
a little dripping for shortening; moisten with warm water
and bind with a raw egg.</p>

<p>If your butcher has not “put up” the fillet, remove
the bone, pin the meat into a round with skewers; then
bind firmly with a strip of muslin passed two or three
times about it. Fill the cavity left by the bone with
dressing, and thrust the same between the folds of the
meat, besides making cuts with a sharp knife to receive
more. Tuck in a strip of fat pork here and there. Baste
three times with salt and water while roasting, afterwards
with its own gravy. At last, dredge once with flour and
baste with butter. Cut the bands, draw out the skewers
carefully, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Corn.</span></h3>

<p>To one can of corn allow a pint of milk (more if the corn
be dry), three eggs, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter,
one of white sugar, pepper and salt to taste. Beat the
eggs very light, rub butter and sugar together and stir in
hard; next, the corn and seasoning; finally, the milk.
Beat hard, and bake in a buttered dish for half an hour,
covered. Then brown by lifting the top. Send up in
the bake-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Cakes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil and mash the potatoes, working in salt and butter
and an egg or two—beaten light. Let them get cold;
make into cakes of size and shape to suit yourself; roll
in raw egg, then in flour, or cracker-dust, and fry quickly
in hot dripping. Take each up as soon as it is done, and
drain with a wire spoon, before laying upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned String-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Cook in their own liquor half an hour, or until very
tender. First, however, cut them into neat lengths.
The comeliness of the dish depends upon this. When
almost done, stir in a tablespoonful of butter, with salt
and pepper. Simmer ten minutes longer, and serve by
draining off the liquid and heaping the beans upon a hot
dish, with a bit of butter on the top. If the can does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
contain liquor enough to cover the beans, add a little
cold water in cooking them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Apple Dumplings.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart prepared flour.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter and the same of lard.</li>
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>Some ripe apples.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the shortening into the flour when you have sifted
and salted the latter. Wet up with milk and roll out
quickly in a sheet less than half an inch thick. Cut into
squares; lay in the centre of each a tart, juicy apple,
pared and cored. Bring the corners of the square together
and pinch to join them neatly. Lay in a baking-pan,
the joined edges downward, and bake to a fine
brown. When done, brush over with butter and shut the
oven door for a minute more to glaze them. Sift powdered
sugar over them, and eat hot.</p>

<p>These are more wholesome and more easily prepared
than boiled dumplings. Eat with sweet sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brandy Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>½ cup of butter.</li>
<li>1 wineglass of brandy. That from brandied peaches—the <i>liqueur</i>, if you have it.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and mace.</li>
</ul>

<p>Warm the butter slightly, work in the sugar until they
form a rich cream, when add brandy and spice. Beat
hard; shape by putting into a mould made <i>very</i> wet with
cold water, and set in a cool place to harden. Should it
not turn out readily by shaking gently, dip for a second
in hot water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Veal and Sago Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. veal.</li>
<li>¼ lb. pearl sago.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat into bits; put on with the water and boil
very slowly, with the pot-lid laid on loosely, four hours,
until the meat is in rags. Strain through coarse net, or a
wire soup-strainer (which you ought to possess), season
with pepper and salt, and return to the kettle when you
have scalded it out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the sago should have been washed and
soaked in lukewarm water, for an hour. Stir it into the
broth and let them simmer, stirring often, half an hour.
Heat the milk scalding hot in another vessel, beat the
yolks of the eggs light, reserving the whites for your
pudding; pour gradually over these a cupful of the hot
milk, and stir carefully into the soup with all the milk.
Taste, to see if it needs more seasoning; add a little
chopped parsley, if you like; let it almost boil and pour
into the tureen. It should be about as thick as boiled
custard. Should the sago thicken it too much, add boiling
water.</p>

<p>A relishful and wholesome soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jugged Rabbit.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 full-grown but tender rabbit or hare.</li>
<li>½ lb. corned ham.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>1 cup of good gravy, saved from yesterday’s roast.</li>
<li>Dripping for frying.</li>
<li>1 onion, sliced.</li>
<li>Juice of 1 lemon.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful currant jelly.</li>
<li>Parsley, pepper and salt, and browned flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Joint the rabbit, and lay for an hour in salted water.
Wipe dry and fry in the dripping, with the onion, until
brown. Put in the bottom of a tin pail, or farina-kettle,
a layer of salt pork cut into strips; upon this one of
rabbit. Sprinkle with pepper and a little salt. Scatter
fried onion over the rabbit and proceed in this order until
your meat is used up. Pour in the gravy; cover
the vessel, and set it in another of cold water. Bring
gradually to a boil and stew steadily one hour, or until
tender. Arrange the meat upon a dish; strain the gravy,
thicken with browned flour wet up with cold water; boil
up once; stir in the jelly and lemon-juice, heat to boiling,
and pour over the rabbit. If you have no gravy, use a
little butter and water instead.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Potatoes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 cups mashed potato.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of milk.</li>
<li>3 hard-boiled eggs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>1 handful very dry bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work butter, milk, and salt into the hot mashed potatoes.
Put a layer in the bottom of a pudding-dish well greased;
cover this with thin slices of egg; salt and pepper; another
stratum of potato, and so on, until the dish is full.
Strew bread-crumbs thickly over the uppermost layer of
potatoes. Stick bits of butter over this and bake, covered,
until hot throughout; then brown quickly. Send up in
the pudding-dish.</p>

<p>A simple and nice side-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes—Fried.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, peel, and when cold, slice the potatoes neatly.
Fry in good dripping until they are of a light brown.
Drain from the fat and eat hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Minced Celery with Egg Dressing.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape and wash the celery and cut into half-inch
lengths, having first crisped it in cold water. Rub the
yolks of two hard-boiled eggs to a paste with a tablespoonful
of oil; add salt, pepper, a little powdered sugar,
vinegar to make the mixture liquid, and pour over the
celery. Serve in a salad-bowl and eat at once, lest the
celery should toughen in the vinegar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni and Almond Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ lb. macaroni.</li>
<li>3 pints of milk.</li>
<li>1 cup of white sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>½ lb. sweet almonds, blanched and chopped.</li>
<li>Rose-water and bitter almond flavoring.</li>
<li>A little salt and nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simmer the macaroni half an hour in a pint of the milk.
When tender, but not broken, put in butter and salt.
Take the saucepan from the fire and turn out the contents
to cool while you make a custard of the rest of the
milk, the eggs and sugar. Add the latter to the scalding
milk, but do not boil the custard. Chop the almonds
when you have blanched them, <i>i. e.</i>, taken off the skins
with boiling water. As you chop, put in a few drops of
rose-water from time to time, to prevent oiling. When
the macaroni is almost cold, mix it with the custard,
breaking it as little as may be. Season, and last of all,
stir in the chopped almonds. Bake in a well-buttered
pudding-dish. Spread with the <i>méringue</i> made from the
whites of the eggs reserved from the soup. Eat warm
with powdered sugar and cinnamon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fish Chowder.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of cod, cut into strips an inch thick and four inches long, and freed from bone so far as is possible without breaking the fish.</li>
<li>1 pint of oysters.</li>
<li>2 large onions cut into thin slices.</li>
<li><i>About</i> ½ lb. Boston crackers, split, and buttered thickly.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>Parsley.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cover the bottom of your soup-kettle with the fish;
pepper and salt; strew with sliced onion, and this with the
split crackers, buttered sides down. Follow this order until
your ingredients are all in the pot, and cover them with
cold water. Stew gently for an hour, keeping the water
at the original level by replenishing from the tea-kettle.
By this time the fish should be thoroughly done, if it has
cooked steadily. Take it up with a perforated skimmer,
and cover in the tureen to keep hot, while you strain the
chowder to get out the bones, returning the crackers with
the liquor to the soup-kettle, when you have rinsed it out.
Thicken with two teaspoonfuls of corn-starch wet up
in a cup of milk, and when this has boiled, add the oysters,
cut small, two great spoonfuls of butter, and a little
chopped parsley. Stew for three minutes, pour slowly
over the fish in the tureen. Send sliced lemon around with
it.</p>

<p>This is a most palatable chowder when properly prepared.
You can use fewer crackers, if you dislike a thick
soup.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Chicken—White.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>One pair of full-grown fowls.</li>
<li>½ lb. salt pork cut into strips.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>1 cupful of milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of flour and the same of butter.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>Parsley, pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Joint the fowls neatly, and cut the back, neck, and
breast apart from each other, the latter into two pieces.
Lay them in salt water for half an hour. Put them into
a pot with enough cold water to cover them, and the
pork cut into thin strips. Cover and heat <i>very</i> slowly.
Stew constantly, but never fast, for one hour after it
comes to a boil, or until the chickens are tender. The
time will depend upon their age. If they are tough, put
them on early and cook all the more slowly. Add now
the onion, parsley, and pepper, with salt, if needed.
Heat again, and stir in the flour wet up in the cup of
milk. Beat the eggs and pour upon them a cupful of
hot gravy; mix well, and put back into the soup with the
butter. Just as the stew begins to simmer again, remove
from the fire. Take out and pile the chicken upon a
dish; then pour the gravy over all.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à l’Italienne.</span></h3>

<p>Instead of mashing the potatoes with a beetle or spoon,
whip them up light with a silver fork. When they are
fine and mealy, beat in a few spoonfuls of milk, a tablespoonful
of butter, the yolks of two eggs, pepper and salt.
Whip into a creamy heap before adding, with a few dexterous
strokes, the stiffly-frothed whites. Pile roughly up
on a buttered pie-dish; brown quickly in the oven, and
transfer, with the help of a cake-turner, to a flat dish.</p>

<p>Make a rather too abundant dish, according to this receipt,
as the residue will be found useful in to-morrow’s
bill of fare.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomatoes Stewed with Onion.</span></h3>

<p>Stew in the usual manner, adding a small onion minced
fine. When they have cooked half an hour, season with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
pepper, salt, a little sugar, and a good spoonful of butter.
Simmer ten minutes more, uncovered, and turn out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Fondu.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of bread-crumbs, dry and fine.</li>
<li>2 scant cups of <i>fresh</i> milk.</li>
<li>½ lb. dry, rich cheese, grated.</li>
<li>3 eggs, whipped light.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of melted butter.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>A pinch of soda, dissolved in hot water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk; beat in the eggs, the butter,
seasoning—lastly, the cheese. Pour into a neat pudding-dish,
strew dry bread-crumbs over the top, and bake
in a quick oven until delicately browned. Serve in the
pudding-dish, and at once, as it <i>falls</i> in cooling.</p>

<p>Very good!</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sponge Gingerbread.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>5 cups of flour, dried and sifted. Measure <i>after</i> sifting.</li>
<li>1 cup of molasses.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 rather larger cup of sour, or buttermilk.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of saleratus (not soda), dissolved in hot water.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls ginger.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of cinnamon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix molasses, sugar, butter, and spice together. Warm
slightly, and beat hard for five minutes. Add the milk,
then the soda, lastly the flour. Beat three minutes, and
bake in a broad, shallow pan. Take heed that it does not
burn. Eat warm.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 tablespoonfuls of chocolate to each pint of boiling water.</li>
<li>As much milk as you have chocolate.</li>
<li>Sweeten to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the chocolate smooth in a little cold water, and
stir into the hot. Boil twenty minutes; put in the milk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and boil five minutes more, stirring often. Sweeten at
pleasure, while boiling, or in the cups. Send around with
the warm gingerbread and some slices of mild cheese.
You will not regret not having prepared a more pretentious
dessert.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clear Gravy Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>5 lbs. lean beef, the coarser parts, of course.</li>
<li>Some bones.</li>
<li>2 slices of lean corned ham.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>6 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>¼ package Coxe’s gelatine.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>A bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>Dripping.</li>
<li>5 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat into dice and slice the onions. Fry the
latter brown in some good dripping. Take them out, and
fry the meat in the same fat, turning often, until it has a
thick brown coat. Put it, drained from the fat, into the
soup-kettle, with two quarts of cold water, and set where
it will come to a boil in about an hour. The bones should
also be fried, and put into the pot with the meat. When
these fairly boil, skim, add three quarts of cold water, and
stew gently four hours. If you dine early, the soup should
go on before breakfast. Put herbs and vegetables, including
the fried onions, all chopped up, into a saucepan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
with enough cold water to cover them, and boil to pieces.
Strain the soup half an hour before dinner; season, return
to the pot; boil and skim. Strain the vegetable
liquor into it, without squeezing or rubbing. Boil up
once more, skim well, and put in the gelatine, which
should have soaked one hour in a little cold water. Simmer
five minutes and pour out.</p>

<p>The soup should be of a clear, light brown. Should the
color not suit you, burn a tablespoonful of sugar in a tin
cup, add three or four spoonfuls of boiling water, stir until
you get a deep color, and turn off the water into the soup.
It will not injure the flavor.</p>

<p>Please never lose sight of the cardinal principle that all
the essence, strength, and taste should be extracted from
meat, vegetables, etc., in soup-making, and that the <i>soup
which boils fast is lost</i>. Take plenty of time, and cast an
eye into the kitchen from hour to hour until you have educated
your cook up to a glimmering appreciation of this
law of enlightened cookery.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Salad.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of oysters, cut, not chopped, into small pieces.</li>
<li>1 bunch of celery, also <i>cut</i> small.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful best oil.</li>
<li>1 small spoonful of salt, and the same of pepper, likewise of mustard (made).</li>
<li>⅛ cup cider vinegar.</li>
<li>Saltspoonful of powdered sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drain the liquor from the oysters and cut them up.
Add the minced celery. Prepare the seasoning, putting in
the vinegar last, and pour the mixture over the celery and
oysters. Toss up well with a silver fork. Do this just
before dinner, as the salad will be injured by lying long in
the dressing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Liver à la Mode.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 calf’s liver.</li>
<li>½ lb. fat salt pork.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter, or dripping.</li>
<li>2 small onions.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>1 tablespoonful chopped parsley and marjoram.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful mixed cloves, mace, and allspice.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful Worcestershire sauce.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash the liver thoroughly, and soak half an hour in
salted water. Wipe, make incisions about an inch apart,
and lard with strips of pork, projecting slightly on each
side. Fry the onions and herbs in the dripping. Take
them out, put in the liver, and fry both sides to a light
brown. Turn all into a saucepan, with the vinegar and
water to cover the liver—barely. Cover closely, and stew
gently an hour and a half. Lay the liver on a hot dish, strain
the gravy, return to the fire, thicken with a tablespoonful
of browned flour, put in the sauce and spice; boil up and
pour some of it over the liver, the rest into a gravy-boat.
What is left from dinner will be nice for luncheon or tea,
cut horizontally in thin slices.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salsify Fritters.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 bunch salsify.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>½ cup milk.</li>
<li>Flour for thin batter.</li>
<li>Lard, or dripping.</li>
<li>Salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scrape and grate the roots, and stir into a batter made
of the beaten eggs, the milk, and flour. Grate the salsify
directly into this, that it may not blacken by exposure to
the air. Salt, and drop a spoonful into the boiling fat to
see if it is of the right consistency. As fast as you fry the
fritters, throw into a hot colander to drain. One great
spoonful of batter should make a fritter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Duchesse.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the remnants of yesterday’s potatoes <i>à l’Italienne</i>
into rounds with a cake-cutter, dipped in cold water. Set
like biscuits, but not so near as to touch one another, in
a greased pan, and bake quickly, brushing top and sides
with beaten egg when they begin to brown. Serve upon
a heated napkin folded flat, on a platter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Meal Fruit Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 <i>heaping</i> cup white Indian meal.</li>
<li>3 pints of milk.</li>
<li>1 cup of flour.</li>
<li>4 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of white sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter.</li>
<li>½ lb. of raisins, seeded and cut in two.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt, and same of mixed mace and cinnamon.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of soda, and two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, sifted <i>twice</i> with the flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scald a pint of milk and wet up the meal with it, stirring
well. While it is cooling, add the flour, wet into batter
with a pint of cold milk. Heat the remaining pint, and
when scalding, add sugar and eggs. Beat this gradually,
<i>hard</i> and long, into the cooled paste. When well mixed,
put in butter, spice, and the fruit dredged with flour.
Beat fast and deep for two minutes. Bake in a buttered
dish, in a tolerably brisk oven. Cover with paper as it
browns. It ought to be done in three-quarters of an hour.
Eat hot, with butter and sugar.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Stew one can of tomatoes half an hour; strain and rub
through a colander into the soup left from yesterday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Heat to a slow boil, and simmer together ten minutes
before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Beef, with Yorkshire Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Have your meat ready for roasting on Saturday, always.
Roast upon a grating or several clean sticks (not pine) laid
over the dripping-pan. Dash a cup of boiling water over the
beef when it goes into the oven; baste often, and see that
the fat does not scorch. About three-quarters of an hour
before it is done, mix the pudding.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Yorkshire Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
<li>2 cups of flour—prepared flour is best.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use less flour if the batter grows too stiff. Mix
quickly; pour off the fat from the top of the gravy in the
dripping-pan, leaving just enough to prevent the pudding
from sticking to the bottom. Pour in the batter and continue
to roast the beef, letting the dripping fall upon the
pudding below. The oven should be brisk by this time.
Baste the meat with the gravy you have taken out to make
room for the batter.</p>

<p>In serving, cut the pudding into squares and lay about
the meat in the dish. It is very delicious.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni al Napolitano.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ lb. of macaroni.</li>
<li>2 nice sweetbreads.</li>
<li>1 small onion, minced.</li>
<li>Parsley, pepper, and salt.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash the sweetbreads; lay in salted water fifteen minutes,
and stew with the onion, in a pint of cold water, a
little salt, until done, as may be seen by cutting into the
thickest part. Wash the macaroni when you have broken
it into small bits, and cook gently until tender, but not to
breaking, in the hot broth from which you have taken the
sweetbreads and strained the onion. Stew in a farina-kettle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
or tin saucepan set in hot water. Chop the sweetbreads;
stir the butter into the macaroni, which should
have absorbed all the broth; then the minced sweetbreads.
Season with parsley, pepper, and salt; cover
closely and leave in the hot water, but not over the fire,
five minutes before turning into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes au Naturel</span></h3>

<p>Are, with all their high-sounding name, only the homely
vegetables boiled in their skins. Put on in cold water,
bring to a slow boil, and increase the heat until a fork will
pierce the largest. Throw in salt; turn off every drop of
the water; set back on the range, without the cover, for
two minutes to dry, peel, and send to table in a napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">French Beans, Sauté.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of French or “string” beans; cut into
inch lengths and boil in the can liquor, adding a little cold
water, if needed, for twenty minutes. Drain, return to
the saucepan with two tablespoonfuls of butter and a little
salt and pepper. Toss constantly with a fork until they
are hissing hot, but not until they scorch. Serve in a hot
vegetable dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, core, and slice tart apples, and stew in water
enough to cover them until they break to pieces. Beat
to a pulp with a good lump of butter and plenty of sugar.
Eat cold. Make enough for several meals, as it will keep
a week at this season.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Made Mustard.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 tablespoonfuls English mustard.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of salt.</li>
<li>The same quantity of salad oil and white sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of pepper.</li>
<li>Vinegar to make a smooth paste—that from celery, or onion pickle, if you have it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub mustard, oil, sugar, pepper, and salt together; wet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
by degrees, with vinegar, beating very hard at the last,
when the proper consistency has been gained.</p>

<p>This is far superior to mustard as usually mixed for the
table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Narcissus Blanc-mange.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>1 package of Cooper’s gelatine, soaked in two cups of cold water.</li>
<li>Yolks of 4 eggs, beaten light.</li>
<li>2 cups of white sugar.</li>
<li>Vanilla and rose-water for flavoring.</li>
<li>Less than 2 cups of rich cream.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk to scalding; stir in gelatine and sugar.
When these are dissolved, take out a cupful and pour, by
degrees, over the beaten yolks. Return to the saucepan
and stir together over the fire for two minutes after the
boiling point is reached. Take from the range, flavor
with rose-water, and pour into a mould with a cylinder in
the centre, previously wet with cold water. Next day,
turn out upon a dish with a broad bottom, and fill the
hollow in the middle with the cream, whipped light with a
little powdered sugar and flavored with vanilla. Pile
more whipped cream about the base.</p>

<p>Send your coffee around after the blanc-mange has been
eaten. A spoonful of whipped cream, without the vanilla,
will give a touch of elegance to the beverage. Let this
happy thought come to you while you are preparing the
cream, and before the flavoring goes in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Variety Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Chop a quarter of a small cabbage, a turnip, and some
sweet herbs; cover with cold water, and heat to boiling.
Throw off the first water, and add a quart more of cold.
Put in the roast-beef bones, after you have cut off the
meat, with a slice or two, or bone, of ham. Stew all two
hours at the back of the range. Half an hour before dinner,
warm up what was left from Sunday’s soup. Strain the
hot liquor in which your cabbage, etc., have boiled, into
this. Pick out bits of bones and meat from the colander,
mashing the vegetables as little as possible; put these
into the soup, with any macaroni or beans you may have
left over; season to your liking; simmer for ten minutes;
thicken with a tablespoonful of corn-starch, and pour out.</p>

<p>This will not be a “show-soup,” but it will be savory
and nutritious.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>A cupful of prepared flour.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of melted butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat from yesterday’s roast into neat pieces;
lay them in the bottom of a buttered pudding-dish, season
well, and pour a few spoonfuls of cold gravy over them,
letting it soak into the meat while you prepare a batter
according to the above directions, taking care not to get
it too stiff. Pour over the meat and bake in a quick oven.
Eat hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scored Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash in the usual way, mixing rather soft; heap and
round upon a greased pie-plate; score deeply in triangles
with the back of a carving or butcher’s knife; brown in
the oven, and slip carefully to another dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of peas an hour before cooking them, that
there may be no musty, airless taste about them, and turn
into a bowl. When ready for them put on in a farina-kettle—or
one saucepan within another—of hot water.
If dry, add cold water to cover them, and stew about
twenty-five minutes. Drain, stir in a generous lump of
butter; pepper and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Méringue.</span></h3>

<p>Butter a neat pudding-dish, and nearly fill it with apple
sauce. Cover and leave in the oven until it is smoking
hot. Draw to the oven door and spread with a méringue
made of the whites of three eggs, whipped stiff with a little
powdered sugar. (Your pudding will be much nicer, by
the way, if you have beaten the yolks into the stewed
apple before putting it into the dish.) Shut the oven
door long enough to brown the <i>méringue</i> very lightly.
Eat nearly or quite cold, with sugar and cream.</p>

<p>Send around crackers and cheese as an accompaniment.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Celery Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of veal, and some bones of the same.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>2 onions.</li>
<li>2 bunches of celery, using the white parts only.</li>
<li>3 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>1 pint of fresh milk.</li>
<li>2 dessertspoonfuls of corn-starch.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>Some fried bread.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the veal up small, crack the bones, and put on in
cold water. Boil slowly four hours, replenishing with
boiling water should the broth sink to less than two-thirds
of the original quantity. Strain, pressing all the
strength out of the meat. Cut the celery into bits, and
stew in the broth, with the minced onions, until so soft
that you can rub through a colander. Strain a second
time, and return the soup, with the pulped celery, to the
fire. Season, and thicken with the corn-starch wet up in
the pint of milk. Stir until it boils, and lastly, put in,
carefully, the butter, after which take from the range.
Have ready a double handful of fried bread in the tureen,
and pour the soup upon it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Cutlets and Ham.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. of veal cutlets, neatly trimmed, and the same of sliced ham.</li>
<li>Yolks of 2 eggs.</li>
<li>Bread- or cracker-crumbs.</li>
<li>Dripping for frying.</li>
</ul>

<p>Divide each cutlet into pieces about two inches wide by
three inches long, and cut the ham into slices of corresponding
size. Dip in the egg, then roll in the bread-crumbs,
and fry—the ham first, afterwards the veal, until
nicely browned on both sides. Sprinkle salt upon the
veal cutlets. Arrange upon the dish in alternate slices
of veal and ham, overlapping one another. Anoint the
ham with butter mixed with a little mustard; the veal
with butter melted up with a spoonful of tart jelly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower with Cream Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Boil your cauliflower, when you have washed and
trimmed it, and tied it up in coarse net or tarletan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Cook in boiling water slightly salted, keeping the stalk
end uppermost. Prepare, in another saucepan, the dressing,
by adding to a cup of scalding milk a tablespoonful
of corn-starch wet up with cold water, two tablespoonfuls
of butter, pepper and salt at discretion. Drain the cauliflower,
remove the net, put into a deep dish, the flower
up, and drench with the boiling sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Cut into slices, cook until tender, but not to breaking,
in hot water. Turn half of this off and replace by as
much milk, in which some slices of onion have been
boiled and strained out. Add pepper and salt, a good
lump of butter rolled in flour, and some chopped parsley.
Simmer three minutes, and turn into a vegetable dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mixed Pickles,</span></h3>

<p>Home-made or bought, should be passed with the cutlets.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jam Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 cups of milk.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>¾ of a cup of sugar.</li>
<li>Bread and butter.</li>
<li>Sweet jam—berry, peach, or quince.</li>
</ul>

<p>Spread slices of stale bread with butter, then with jam.
Fit them closely into a buttered pudding-dish until it is
two-thirds full. Make a custard by adding the beaten
eggs and sugar to the scalding milk, but do not let them
boil. Lay a heavy saucer upon the bread and butter to
prevent floating, and moisten gradually with the hot custard.
Let all soak for fifteen minutes before the dish
goes into the oven. When it is hot throughout, take off
the saucer, that the pudding may brown equally. Eat
cold.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sheep’s-head Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Get your butcher to clean a sheep’s head with the skin
on, as he would a calf’s head for soup. Let him also
split it in half that you may get at the brains. Take
them out, with the tongue, and set aside. Break the bone
of the head, wash it well in several waters, and soak for half
an hour in salted water. Cover it with fresh water, and
heat gradually to a boil. Drain off the water, and thus
remove any peculiar odor from the wool or other causes,
and add four quarts of cold water, with two turnips, two
roots of salsify, two carrots, two stalks of celery, and a
bunch of sweet herbs, all chopped fine. Boil slowly four
hours. Strain the soup into a bowl, pressing all the
nourishment out of the meat, and let it stand in a cool
place until the fat rises thickly to the surface to be taken
off. The vegetables should be soft enough to pass freely
through a fine colander, or coarse strainer, when rubbed.
While the soup cools, prepare the force-meat balls. The
tongue and brains should have been cooked and chopped
up, then rubbed to a paste together and mixed with an
equal quantity of bread-crumbs, salt, pepper, and parsley,
bound with a raw egg, and rolled into small balls, dipped
in flour. Set them, not so near as to touch one another,
in a tin plate or dripping-pan, and put in a quick oven
until a crust is formed upon the top, when they must be
allowed to cool. Return the skimmed broth to the fire;
season; boil up once; take off the scum, and add a
cup of milk in which you have stirred a tablespoonful
of corn-starch. Simmer, stirring all the while, for two
minutes after it boils. Put the force-meat balls into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
tureen and pour the soup gently over them so as not to
break them.</p>

<p>This is a good and cheap soup, and deserves to be
better known.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Hare.</span></h3>

<p>Have the hare skinned and well cleaned. Cooks are
often careless about the latter duty. Stuff, as you would
a fowl, with a force-meat of bread-crumbs, chopped fat
pork, a little sweet marjoram, onion, pepper, and salt,
just moistened with hot water. Sew up the hare with fine
cotton; tie the legs close to the body in a kneeling position.
The English cook it with the head on, but we take it
off as more seemly in our eyes. Lay in the dripping-pan,
back uppermost; pour two cups of boiling water over it;
cover with another pan and bake, closely covered, except
when you baste it with butter and water, for three-quarters
of an hour. Uncover, baste freely with the gravy
until nicely browned; dredge with flour and anoint with
butter until a fine froth appears on the surface. Take up
the hare, put on a hot dish, and keep covered while you
make the gravy. Strain, and skim that left in the pan;
season, thicken with browned flour, stir in a good spoonful
of currant-jelly, and some chopped parsley; boil up;
pour a few spoonfuls of it over the hare; serve the rest
in a gravy-boat. Clip, instead of tearing hard at the cotton
threads. Send currant-jelly around with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni and Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Break the macaroni into inch lengths, and stew ten
minutes in boiling water. Meanwhile, cut two slices of
corned (not smoked) ham into dice, wash well and put on
to boil in a cup of cold water. Drain the macaroni, and
when the ham has cooked for ten minutes after coming to
a boil, pour it, with the liquor, over the macaroni. Season
with pepper, simmer in a closed farina-kettle for fifteen
minutes; add a little chopped parsley, cover, and
let it stand a minute more, and serve in a deep dish. The
fatter the ham the better for this dish. Always pass grated
cheese with stewed macaroni.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and wipe large, fair potatoes, and bake soft.
Cut a round piece from the top of each, and carefully preserve
it. Scrape out the inside with a spoon without
breaking the skin, and set aside the empty cases with the
covers. Mash the potato which you have taken out,
smoothly, working into it butter, a raw egg, a little cream,
pepper, and salt. When soft, heat in a saucepan set over
the fire in boiling water. Stir until smoking hot, fill the
skins with the mixture, put on the caps, set in the oven
for three minutes, and send to table wrapped in a heated
napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, sliced or quartered, until soft all through; drain
well and mash in a colander with a wooden spoon or
beetle, very quickly, lest they should cool. Cold turnips
are detestable. Work in a little salt and a good lump of
butter; serve in a hot dish, smoothly rounded on top,
with a pat of pepper here and there.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fig Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ lb. good dried figs, washed, wiped, and minced.</li>
<li>2 cups fine, dry bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>½ cup beef suet, powdered.</li>
<li>2 scant cups of milk.</li>
<li>½ cup of white sugar.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
<li>A pinch of soda, dissolved in hot water and stirred into the milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk. Add the eggs, beaten
light, with the sugar, salt, suet, and figs. Beat three minutes,
put in a buttered mould with a tight top; set in
boiling water with a weight on the cover, to prevent the
mould from upsetting, and boil three hours.</p>

<p>Eat hot, with hard sauce, or butter and powdered sugar,
mixed with nutmeg. It is very good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Veal and Rice Broth.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 lbs. knuckle of veal, well broken up.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>2 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>½ cup of rice, washed and picked over.</li>
<li>Chopped parsley, pepper, and salt.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>4 qts. of cold water.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful corn-starch.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put on the veal and bones, with the onion and celery
minced, in four quarts of cold water. Boil gently after
it begins to bubble, four hours, keeping the pot-lid on.
Soak the rice in lukewarm water, enough to cover it well—adding
warmer as it swells—for one hour. Cook in
the same water, never touching with a spoon, but <i>shaking</i>
up from the bottom, now and then. Strain and press
the soup into a bowl; cool to throw up the fat for the
skimmer, and return to the pot. Salt and pepper; boil
up and skim, and stir in the corn-starch wet up in the
milk. Simmer three minutes; put in the rice with the
water in which it was boiled, and the parsley. Simmer
very gently five minutes, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton à la Jardinière.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>5 lbs. of mutton, breast or neck, all in one piece.</li>
<li>2 onions, peeled.</li>
<li>1 carrot, peeled.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>2 turnips, peeled.</li>
<li>1 pint canned tomatoes.</li>
<li>A few sprigs of cauliflower.</li>
<li>2 stalks of blanched celery.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of corn-starch.</li>
<li>Dripping for frying.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fry the mutton (whole) in a large frying-pan, until it is
lightly browned on both sides. Put into a deep, broad
saucepan with all the vegetables (also whole) except the
tomatoes; cover with cold water, and stew, closely covered,
for an hour after they begin to boil. Take out the
vegetables, and set aside; add boiling water to the meat,
if it is not covered, and simmer steadily, never fast, two
hours longer. The meat should be tender throughout,
even the fibres. Turn off all the gravy, except about
half a cupful, fit the pot-lid on very tightly, and leave the
meat where it will keep just below the cooking-point.
Strain the gravy you have poured off; leave it to cool
until the fat rises. Skim, and return to the pot with the
tomatoes. Season, and boil <i>fast</i>, skimming two or three
times, until it is reduced to one-half the original quantity,
or just enough to half cover the meat. Thicken with
corn-starch, and put in the meat, with its juices from the
bottom of the pot. Simmer, closely covered, half an
hour. Cut the now cooled vegetables into neat dice;
put the butter into a saucepan, and when it is hot, the
vegetables. Shake all together until smoking hot, season,
add a little gravy from the meat, and leave them to keep
hot in it while you dish the mutton. Put it in the middle
of a flat dish, and put the vegetables around it in separate
mounds, with sprigs of parsley or celery between. Pour
gravy over the mutton.</p>

<p>Try this dish. It is not difficult of preparation, diffuse
as I have made the directions. It is, if well managed
and discreetly seasoned, a family dinner of itself, and a
very cheap one.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Puff.</span></h3>

<p>Mash the potatoes as usual; beat in more milk than is
your custom, and a couple of eggs, whipping all to a cream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and seasoning well. Pour into a buttered pudding-dish,
and bake quickly to a good brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pork and Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Soak a quart of dried beans overnight in soft water.
Change this for more and warmer in the morning, and,
two hours later, put them on to boil in cold. When they
are soft, drain well, put into a deep dish; and sink in the
middle a pound of salt pork (the “middling” is best),
leaving only the top visible. The pork should have been
previously parboiled. Bake to a fine brown. It is well to
score the pork in long furrows to mark the slices, before
baking.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Minced Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 large juicy pippins, pared, cored, and chopped.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of raisins, seeded and chopped.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls beef suet, freed from strings and rubbed to powder.</li>
<li>12 almonds, blanched and minced.</li>
<li>½ cup of sugar for pudding, and three tablespoonfuls for custard.</li>
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>Stale bread.</li>
<li>Butter to spread it.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>Nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the crust from the bread and slice evenly. Butter
a shallow pudding-dish, and line it with the slices, fitted
neatly together, and well buttered. Spread thickly with a
mixture of the ingredients just enumerated, to wit: apples,
raisins, suet, and almonds, sweetened with sugar, and
spiced with nutmeg. They should form a paste and adhere
to the bread. Make a custard by scalding and
sweetening the milk, then pouring gradually over the
eggs. Soak the bread, etc., with this by pouring it on, a
few spoonfuls at a time, until the dish is full. Bake in a
moderate oven, for a time covered, lest it should dry out.
Eat cold, with powdered sugar sifted over the top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apples, Nuts, and Raisins</span></h3>

<p>Should be served on clean plates after the pudding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Purée of Peas.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pint of split peas, soaked overnight in soft water.</li>
<li>3 onions—small.</li>
<li>3 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>2 carrots—small.</li>
<li>1 bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>1 pint of tomatoes.</li>
<li>Season to taste.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of butter rolled in flour.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put all on to cook together, except the tomatoes and
butter. The vegetables must be chopped fine. Stew
steadily and gently three hours. Rub to a purée through
a sieve, and put in the tomatoes, freed of bits of skin and
cores, and cut into bits. Season, and return to the fire to
stew for twenty minutes longer, closely covered. Stir in
the butter—divided into teaspoonfuls, each rolled in flour.
Boil up and serve. Dice of fried bread should be put into
the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Bass.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wipe dry, inside and out, dredge with flour, and
season with salt. Fry in hot butter, beef-dripping, or sweet
lard. Half butter, half lard is a good mixture for frying
fish. The moment the fish are done to a good brown,
take them from the fat and drain in a hot colander. Garnish
with parsley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes</span></h3>

<p>Must accompany the fish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Chicken.</span></h3>

<p>Wash well in three waters, adding a little soda to the
second. Stuff with a mixture of bread-crumbs, butter,
pepper, and salt. Fill the crops and bodies of the fowls;
sew them up with strong, not coarse thread, and tie up the
necks. Pour a cupful of boiling water over the pair, and
roast an hour—or more, if they are large. Baste three
times with butter and water, four or five times with their
own gravy.</p>

<p>Stew the giblets, necks, and feet in water, enough to
cover them well. When you take up the fowls, add this
liquor to the gravy left in the dripping-pan, boil up once,
thicken with browned flour; add the giblets chopped fine;
boil again, and send up in a gravy-boat.</p>

<p>Should there be more gravy than you need, set it away
carefully. Each day brings forth a need for such.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crab-apple Jelly</span></h3>

<p>Is a pleasing sauce for roast fowls.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Celery.</span></h3>

<p>Select the best blanched stalks, and lay aside in cold
water. Stew three or four stalks of the coarser parts,
minced, with a small onion, a few sprigs of parsley, also
chopped, and a bone of ham, or other meat. Stew for an
hour in enough water to cover them; strain, pressing hard.
Cut the choicer celery into pieces two inches long; pour
over them the “stock” from the strainer, season with pepper,
and, if needed, salt. Stew until very tender. Stir in a
good tablespoonful of butter, and a little corn-starch, wet
up in cold water. Simmer gently three minutes, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Salsify.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape and lay in cold water ten minutes. Boil tender,
drain, and when cold, mash with a wooden spoon, picking
out the fibrous parts. Wet to a paste with milk, work in
a little butter, and an egg and a half for each cupful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
salsify. Beat the eggs very light. Season to taste, make
into round, flat cakes, dredge with flour, and fry to a light
brown. Drain off the fat, and serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Margherita Lemon Custard.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>Half the grated peel of a lemon.</li>
<li>5 tablespoonfuls of white sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the whites of two eggs and the yolks of five very
light; add the sugar and pour over these the milk, scalding
hot. Lastly, put in the grated peel, pour into a buttered
pudding-dish, and set in a pan of hot water. Put
both into the oven, and bake the custard until it is well
“set.” Then spread with a <i>méringue</i> made of the reserved
whites beaten stiff with a little powdered sugar.
Shut the oven door, and cook the <i>méringue</i> until slightly
tinged with yellow-brown. Eat cold.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">English Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 lbs. brisket of beef, cut into thin strips.</li>
<li>2 onions, sliced and fried in dripping.</li>
<li>The bones of yesterday’s chickens.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>3 turnips.</li>
<li>4 stalks of celery.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>1 bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of vermicelli.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt at discretion.</li>
<li>6 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the beef, cut into strips, the  “carcasses” of the
chickens broken to pieces, and three quarts of cold water,
into a large soup-pot, and heat gradually. When it boils,
skim well, and add the fried onion and other vegetables,
cut fine, and three quarts more of <i>cold</i> water. Stew, with
the pot-lid on, five hours, after it again boils, giving it no
attention save to see that it never boils fast, and that the
liquid has not diminished to less than three-quarters of the
original quantity. Strain at the end of this time, first taking
out the meat that has not boiled to shreds, and the
bones. Rub the vegetables through the colander; afterwards
strain the soup again through your wire strainer or
sieve, into the kettle when you have washed it out. Season,
and simmer ten minutes after the boil recommences,
skimming often. Break the vermicelli into short lengths,
put into the soup when you have taken out two quarts
for Sunday’s “stock.” Cook gently twelve minutes after
the vermicelli goes in.</p>

<p>At first glance, the quantity of meat prescribed for this
soup may seem extravagant; but, apart from the fact that
the coarser and cheaper quality is used, you must note
that you have now the foundation of three days’ soups,
and that you have saved time, no less than money, by
making this as I have directed. It is by the long, intelligent
look ahead that the mistress proves her right to the
title.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Chops—Broiled.</span></h3>

<p>Next to beef, good mutton, properly cooked, deserves
the most prominent place among the meats upon your
weekly bill of fare. It is digestible, nutritious, and, as a
rule, popular. I therefore offer no apology for the regular
and frequent appearance of these two standard articles
of diet upon these pages. They may well be named the
two staves of healthful existence—for civilized humanity,
at least.</p>

<p>Trim your mutton chops, if your butcher has neglected
to do it, leaving a naked end of bone as a “handle” upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
each. Lay them for fifteen minutes in a little melted
butter, turning them several times. Then hold each up
for a moment, to let all the butter drip off that will, and
broil over a clear fire, watching constantly and turning
them often when the falling fat threatens a blaze from below.
If your gridiron is beneath the grate, they can be
cooked far more satisfactorily, and with one-tenth of the
trouble. Pepper and salt when they are laid upon a hot
dish, and put a bit of butter upon each.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Pickles</span></h3>

<p>“Go” well with broiled chops. For receipts for these
and other pickles, with preserves and fruit jellies, the
reader is respectfully referred to “<span class="smcap">Common Sense in
the Household, No. 1, General Receipts</span>.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Browned Potato.</span></h3>

<p>Mash your potatoes with milk, butter, and salt; heap
as irregularly as possible in a vegetable dish, and hold a
red-hot shovel close to them. They will brown more
quickly if you glaze them with butter so soon as a crust
is formed by the hot shovel, then heat it again and repeat
the browning.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>To one can of tomatoes allow a saltspoonful of salt,
half as much pepper, a teaspoonful of sugar, and a great
tablespoonful of butter. Drain off half the liquor, season
thus, and stew <i>fast</i> for twenty minutes, in a vessel set
within another filled with water on the hard boil. This
receipt was given to me by a notable housewife. It is
worth trying for her sake—and variety’s.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Fritters.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 cups of milk.</li>
<li>2 cups of prepared flour.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
<li>Lard for frying.</li>
<li>6 or 8 sweet oranges.</li>
<li>A little powdered sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Take the peel and thick white skin from the oranges.
Slice, and take out the seeds. Make a batter of the ingredients
given above, taking care not to get it too thin.
Dip each slice in this dexterously and fry in boiling lard.
Drain in a hot colander, and eat with the sauce given
below.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beehive Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ cup of butter.</li>
<li>2 cups of sugar.</li>
<li>Juice and peel of a lemon.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of nutmeg.</li>
<li>¼ cup of currant jelly, or cranberry syrup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make hard sauce in the usual way by creaming the butter
and sugar. Before beating in the lemon-juice and
nutmeg, set aside three tablespoonfuls to be colored.
Having added lemon and spice to the larger quantity,
color the less by whipping in currant jelly or cranberry
syrup, until it is of a rich pink. Shape the white sauce
into a conical mound. Roll a sheet of note paper into
a long, narrow funnel, tie a string about it to keep it in
shape, and fill with colored sauce. Squeeze it gently
through the aperture at the small end, beginning at the
base, and winding round the cone to the top, guiding it
so that the white will show prettily between the pink
ridges.</p>

<p>The effect is pleasing and costs little trouble to produce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee</span></h3>

<p>Is believed by some to aid digestion, and, since fritters
are not generally classed among very wholesome dainties,
it may be as well to give John and John’s wife—<i>not</i> the
children—a cup of the fragrant elixir as a possible preventive
against an attack of dyspepsia. It always lends
grace even to a homely dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">German Sago Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Soak half a cup of German sago in enough water to
cover it entirely for two hours. Heat yesterday’s soup
to boiling, with a little of the reserved “stock,” should the
supply be too small; stir in the sago with a little salt,
until dissolved, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Turkey and Oyster Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>15 oysters.</li>
<li>A little milk, bread-crumbs, butter and seasoning.</li>
<li>Wheat flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop about fifteen oysters and work up with them
bread-crumbs, a spoonful of butter, with pepper and salt.
Stuff the turkey as for roasting; sew it up, neatly, in a thin
cloth fitted to every part, having dredged the cloth well
inside with flour. Boil slowly, especially at first, allowing
fifteen minutes to a pound. The water should be lukewarm
when the turkey goes in. Salt and save the liquor
in which the fowl was boiled.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>12 oysters, cut into thirds.</li>
<li>1 cupful of milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls rice, or wheat flour.</li>
<li>Flavoring to taste.</li>
<li>Chopped parsley.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Drain the liquor from the oysters before you cut them
up. Boil the liquor two minutes, and add the milk.
When this is scalding hot, strain and return to the saucepan.
Wet the flour with cold water and stir into the
sauce. As it thickens, put in the butter, then pepper and
salt, with a very little parsley. The juice of a half a
lemon is a pleasant flavoring. Stir it in after taking the
sauce from the fire. Before this, and so soon as the flour
is well incorporated with the other ingredients, add the
oysters, each cut into three pieces. Simmer five minutes
and pour into a gravy-tureen. Some also pour a little
over the turkey on the dish. Garnish with slices of boiled
egg and celery tops.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Savory Rice Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 teacupful of rice.</li>
<li>Giblets of the turkey.</li>
<li>A slice of fat salt pork, chopped very fine.</li>
<li>Half a <i>small</i> onion, also minced.</li>
<li>1 small cup of milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash the rice thoroughly; clean the giblets; soak
them an hour in salted water, cut each into several
pieces, and put on to stew with the pork and rice in nearly
a quart of cold water. Cook slowly until the giblets are
tender and the rice soft. The grains should be kept as
whole as possible, so do not use a spoon in stirring, but
shake up the saucepan, which should be set in another
of boiling water. The rice should, by this time, be nearly
dry. Take out the giblets and chop fine. Pour on the
rice the milk, previously heated with the minced onions,
and then strained. When this is again scalding, stir in
the giblets, then the butter and seasoning. Cover and
simmer for ten minutes. Wet a round or oval pan with
cold water; press the rice firmly into it, so that it may
take the shape, and turn out carefully upon a flat dish.
Set in the oven for two minutes before sending to table.
It should be stiff enough to take the mould, yet not dry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes au Maître d’Hôtel.</span></h3>

<p>Slice cold boiled potatoes a quarter of an inch thick,
and put into a saucepan containing enough milk, already
heated, to cover them—barely. When all are smoking
hot, add a tablespoonful or more of butter, pepper, salt,
and minced parsley. Add a teaspoonful of flour wet in
cold water; heat quickly to a boil; put in the juice of half
a lemon; pour into a deep dish without further cooking.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Celery and Grape Jelly</span></h3>

<p>Should flank the castor, or <i>épergne</i>, or whatever may
be your centre-piece.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mince Pie.</span></h3>

<p>A receipt for mince-meat will be found in the proper
order in the <i>menu</i> for next December. I take it for
granted that, like the wise woman you are, you have laid
up in the store-room enough from your Christmas supply
to last for some weeks to come. If not, let me advise
you to get a box of “<span class="smcap">Atmore’s Celebrated Mince-Meat</span>,”
and fill your pastry-crusts, instead of repeating so
soon the tedious operation so lately performed. It comes
in neat, wooden cans, and is really <i>good</i>. If you like, you
can add more sugar and brandy. N. B.—<i>My</i> John has a
sweet tooth. Has yours?</p>

<p>Make the paste by rubbing into a quart of your best
flour one-third of a pound of sweet lard. Chop it in with
a broad knife, if you have plenty of time. Wet up with
ice-water, roll out very thin, and cover with “dabs” of
butter, also of the best. Fold into a tight roll, flatten with
a few strokes of the rolling-pin, and roll out into a sheet
as thin as the first; baste again with the butter; roll up
and out into a third sheet hardly thicker than drawing-paper;
a third time dot with butter, and fold up closely.
Having used as much butter for this purpose as you have
lard, set aside your last roll for an hour in a very cold
place. Then roll out, line your pie-plates with the paste,
fill with mince-meat; put strips, cut with a jagging-iron,
across them in squares or triangles, and bake in a steady,
never a dull, heat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>These pies, like all others, must be made on Saturday,
and warmed up for Sabbath—unless you prefer to line
your plates on Saturday, and set them aside until next
day, then fill the raw, crisp paste with the mince-meat,
and bake. The paste will be the better, instead of worse,
for standing overnight, and the trouble of baking scarcely
exceed that of warming over.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bananas and Oranges</span></h3>

<p>May solace the disappointment of the dyspeptic or very
juvenile members of the family party, who “dare not touch
mince pie.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Combination Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Put the remains of yesterday’s soup and of the stock
reserved on Saturday together, and heat almost to boiling.
Split and toast crisp half a dozen Boston crackers; butter
while hot, set in the oven until the butter has soaked in,
when put on more. Lay in the bottom of your soup-tureen,
wet with a little boiling milk, and when they have
soaked this up, pour on the soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mince of Fowl.</span></h3>

<p>Set what was left of yesterday’s oyster-sauce over the
fire to heat, thinning, if necessary, with a little milk. Or,
if you have no sauce, substitute a cupful of drawn butter,
made from the liquor in which the turkey was boiled on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Sunday, reserving the rest for another day’s soup. Cut
the meat closely from the bones of the turkey (saving
these, also). Set aside the white flesh for a nice little dish
of salad. Cut the rest, freed from skin and gristle, into
pieces of nearly uniform length, not more than an inch
long. When your sauce boils, put in the meat, simmer
until smoking hot, then take off the saucepan, and pour
gradually over two beaten eggs. Cover the bottom of a
pudding-dish with bread-crumbs, when you have greased it
well; season the mince to taste; fill up the dish with it; put
another layer of bread-crumbs, on top, and stick bits of
butter over these. Bake covered, until bubbling hot, then
brown lightly. This will be found very delightful.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Turkey Salad.</span></h3>

<p>The white meat of the turkey cut up in small pieces.
An equal quantity of blanched celery, also cut into lengths.
Salt slightly, and when dinner is nearly ready pour over
them a dressing made of the yolks of three hard-boiled
eggs rubbed to a powder with a teaspoonful of sugar,
half as much salt, pepper and made mustard, when
worked into a paste with two tablespoonfuls of oil, and
six of vinegar. Toss up the salad well with a silver fork,
and garnish with white of egg cut into rings.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes—Baked.</span></h3>

<p>Select those which are nearly of a size, and not too
large, or so small as to shrivel into dry husks. Wash,
wipe, and bake in a moderate oven until, by pinching,
you find that they are soft at heart.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brussels Sprouts.</span></h3>

<p>Wash carefully, cut off the lower part of the stems, and
lay in cold water, slightly salted, for half an hour. Cook
quickly, in boiling water, with a very little salt, for fifteen
minutes, or until tender. Drain thoroughly, heap neatly
upon a dish, and put a few spoonfuls of melted butter,
peppered to taste, upon them. Eat hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Macaroni.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ lb. of macaroni.</li>
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of cream.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>Nutmeg and vanilla.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Break the macaroni into short pieces, put into a farina-kettle,
cover with the milk, put on the lid of the kettle,
and cook with boiling water in the outer vessel, until the
milk is soaked up and the macaroni looks clear, but has
not begun to break. Add the butter, sugar, and flavoring,
and, if you have it, a few spoonfuls of cream. If you
have not, thicken a little milk slightly with corn-starch,
and use instead. Cover, and set in the boiling water for
ten minutes longer. Serve in a deep dish, and send around
canned or brandied peaches with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate</span>.</h3>

<p>To one pint of boiling water allow six tablespoonfuls
of grated chocolate wet up to a paste in cold water.
Boil twenty minutes, put in one pint of milk and boil ten
minutes more. Stir often. It saves time, if you know
the tastes of those who are to drink it, if you sweeten it
in the saucepan.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mother’s Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Bones of yesterday’s turkey, with the stuffing.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>A slice of lean ham.</li>
<li>The bone from your steak, and half a can of sweet corn.</li>
<li>1 onion, small.</li>
<li>1 stalk of celery.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put on bones, ham (chopped), and the vegetables, cut
up with the sweet herbs, but not the corn, in a soup-kettle;
cover well with the liquor in which the turkey was cooked,
and boil slowly, untouched, two hours. Take out the
bones, and strain the soup, rubbing the vegetables through
the strainer, into a bowl. Return this to the fire and
with it the corn and turkey dressing. Bring to a gentle
boil and keep it steady, for fully half an hour. Season,
and simmer a quarter of an hour longer. The corn and
dressing will thicken it sufficiently.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak with Onions.</span></h3>

<p>While your steak is broiling, watched by some one else,
fry three or four sliced onions in a pan with some beef
dripping or butter. Stir and shake them until they begin
to brown. Dish your steak, salt and pepper, and lay the
onions on top. Cover, and let all stand where they will
keep hot, for five minutes. Do not help onions to any
one unless you are sure that he likes them.</p>

<p>There is no dish so good for keeping a steak hot, yet
juicy, as a hot-water chafing-dish. No household can
afford to be without one, if no more.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mixed Pickles</span></h3>

<p>Give the needed piquancy to steak. Home-made ones
are best.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet and Irish Potatoes—Chopped.</span></h3>

<p>Chop cold boiled Irish potatoes and mix with them the
cold sweet ones left from Monday—in equal parts, if
convenient—or, if you have but two or three, make them
do. There is philosophy, and religion, too, sometimes,
in “making things do.” Heating a little butter in a
saucepan, stir in the potatoes when it begins to “fizzle.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Shake and toss them up with a wooden fork until they
are very hot; season with pepper and salt, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn and Tomatoes Stewed.</span></h3>

<p>To a can of tomatoes add the half can of corn left from
your soup. Stew together half an hour, with a little
minced onion; then pepper and salt to taste, and stir in
a great spoonful of butter with a very little sugar. Simmer
ten minutes before turning out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crème du Thé, Café et Chocolat.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>1 package of Cooper’s gelatine.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls grated chocolate.</li>
<li>1 cup <i>strong</i> tea.</li>
<li>1 cup of strong coffee.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the gelatine for an hour in a cup of cold water.
Heat the milk to boiling and add the gelatine. So soon
as this is dissolved, put in the sugar, stir until melted,
and take the saucepan from the fire. Strain through thin
muslin and divide into three parts. Into the largest stir
the chocolate, rubbed smooth in cold water; into another
the tea, and into a third equal to the second, the coffee.
Return that containing the chocolate to the farina-kettle,
and heat scalding hot, stirring all the while. Rinse out
the kettle well with boiling water, and put in, successively,
those portions flavored with the tea and the coffee, scalding
the vessel between each. Wet several small cups or
glasses with cold water. Pour the chocolate into some,
the tea into others, and the coffee blanc-mange into the
rest. When cold, turn out upon a flat dish, and eat with
sugar and sweet cream. It will “form” in about six
hours. This is a dessert by no means tedious or difficult
of preparation, and is worth trying, being both dainty and
wholesome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lexington Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. of veal.</li>
<li>1 lb. of mutton, with some bones.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>1 carrot.</li>
<li>½ cup of rice.</li>
<li>1 cup of split peas.</li>
<li>4 quarts of water.</li>
<li>Sweet herbs, pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mince the meat and vegetables and crack the bones.
The peas should have been soaked overnight in soft
water, the rice washed and picked over. Put all together
in your soup-kettle, pour in the water and stew gently,
covered, five hours. Should the water waste too much,
put in more from the tea-kettle. At the end of this time,
strain, rubbing the vegetables through a colander. Return
to the fire, season, and boil slowly ten minutes, skimming
carefully. Put sliced lemon, from which the yellow rind
has been pared, into the tureen, and pour the soup upon
it. Serve a slice in each plateful.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Chickens and Macaroni.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and stuff your chickens as for roasting;
sew each up in a piece of new tarlatan, fitted snugly to
the shape. Boil, putting them down in pretty hot, but
not scalding water, allowing twelve minutes to the number
of pounds in <i>one</i> of the pair, and that the larger.
About half an hour before they are to be served take out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a large cupful of the liquor from the pot and put into a
saucepan. Season it, and boil for five minutes with a
small chopped onion. Strain, and when again hot, drop
in a double handful of macaroni, broken into short lengths.
Cook until tender, by which time the liquor should be absorbed
by the macaroni. The saucepan should be set in
another, holding boiling water, that there may be no
danger of scorching while stewing. Make a flattened
mound of the macaroni upon a hot dish; lay the chickens
upon it, and anoint them well with melted butter, made
more salt than usual. Serve them out together, and have
grated cheese for such as wish it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chow-Chow,</span></h3>

<p>Or “picklette,” in American store-rooms—is a keen appetizer
and especially harmonious with boiled fowls. For
receipt for making in winter or summer, see “General
Receipts, No. 1, Common Sense Series,” page 491.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Parsnip Cakes.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape, wash, boil, and mash the parsnips. When cold,
season with salt and pepper, and, flouring your hands,
make them into small, flat cakes. Roll in flour and fry
in boiling dripping. Drain dry and send up on a hot
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Whipped Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Instead of mashing the potatoes in the ordinary way,
whip with a fork until light and dry. Then whip in a
little melted butter and some milk with salt to taste, beating
up fast until you have a creamy compound, almost
like a <i>méringue</i>. Pile as lightly and irregularly as you
can upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jam Roley-Poley.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of <i>prepared</i> flour.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter and the same of lard.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk, or enough to make soft dough.</li>
<li>1 large cup of fruit or berry jam.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub lard and butter into the flour, with a little salt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
wet with cold milk into a soft paste. Roll out into a
pretty thick crust—say about a quarter of an inch—and
trim into an oblong sheet. Spread this generously with
jam, leaving a margin at each end. Roll up closely, the
fruit inside. Pinch the open ends together, and baste
neatly in a floured bag fitted to the roll, but not so tightly
as to interfere with the swelling of the pudding. Boil an
hour and a half in hot water that, from first to last, is not
once off the boil. Dip the cloth into cold water before
attempting to turn the roley-poley out—but for one hasty
second only.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wine Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>2 cupfuls of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>½ cup of wine.</li>
<li>Grated peel of half a lemon.</li>
<li>½ cupful of boiling water.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of corn-starch.</li>
<li>Nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream the butter and sugar, adding the boiling water,
a little at a time, until you have used the half cupful.
Put on in a saucepan, and stir in the corn-starch wet up
with cold milk. When it has thickened, put in the lemon-peel
and nutmeg. Simmer one minute, add the wine,
put on the lid of the saucepan and set in hot water to
keep warm until wanted.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apples and Nuts,</span></h3>

<p>Being cheap and abundant at this season, should form the
sequel of many dinners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">White Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Skeletons of yesterday’s chickens.</li>
<li>3 or 4 lbs. of veal bones, cracked to pieces.</li>
<li>1 lb. of lean veal, cut small.</li>
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>1 egg.</li>
<li>1 small cup of <i>boiled</i> farina.</li>
<li>Salt, pepper, minced onion and parsley for seasoning.</li>
<li>1 quart of water, and liquor in which chickens were boiled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cover the broken chicken and veal bones, the minced
veal, parsley, and onion with the cold water and chicken
liquor and simmer three hours, until the three quarts are
reduced to two. Strain the liquor; put back into the
pot; salt and pepper; boil gently and skim for ten minutes
before adding the milk and boiled farina. Simmer
another ten minutes; take out a cupful and pour over
the beaten egg. Mix well, and put with the soup; let all
stand covered, off the fire, two minutes, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Langue de Bœuf, or Beef’s Tongue.</span></h3>

<p>Get your butcher to save you a fresh, large beef’s
tongue, the finest he can get. Soak, in cold water, a little
salt, six hours—overnight, if you choose—changing the
water before you go to bed. Wipe it, trim and scrape it,
and plunging into boiling water, keep it at a slow boil for
an hour and a half. Take it up, pepper and salt; brush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
over with beaten egg and coat thickly with bread-crumbs;
lay in your dripping-pan and bake, basting often with butter
melted in a <i>little</i> water. Half an hour in a good oven
should suffice. Put on a hot dish and cover while you
prepare the sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sauce Piquante.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cupful of the liquor in which the tongue was boiled.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of made mustard.</li>
<li>A little salt and pepper.</li>
<li>1 heaping tablespoonful of browned flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful mixed parsley and sweet marjoram.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of onion vinegar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Brown the butter by shaking it over a clear fire in a
saucepan. Heat the cupful of liquor to a boil, skim and
season it with salt and pepper. Skim again before stirring
in the flour wet up with cold water. As it thickens,
put in the butter, herbs, mustard, and vinegar. Boil up,
pour half over the tongue, the rest into a sauce-boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Brains and Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of green peas an hour before cooking them,
and turn into a bowl. If there is not liquor in the can to
cover them, add a little water, slightly salted, and cook
over twenty minutes after they boil. Drain, pepper and
salt; stir in a lump of butter nearly as large as an egg,
and put into a vegetable dish, the fried brains arranged
along the base of the mound.</p>

<p>Wash a calf’s brains in several waters; scald in boiling,
then lay in ice-cold water, for half an hour. Wipe,
and beat them into a paste; season, work in a little
butter, a beaten egg, and enough flour to hold the paste
together. Fry upon a griddle in small cakes. Drain off
every drop of fat. Eat hot.</p>

<p>A nice and savory garnish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hominy Croquettes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups fine hominy, boiled and cold.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of melted butter.</li>
<li>Salt to taste.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work the butter into the hominy until the latter is
smooth; then the eggs, salt and sugar. Beat hard with a
wooden spoon to get out lumps and mix well. Make
into oval balls with floured hands. Roll each in flour,
and fry in sweet dripping or lard, putting in a few at a
time and turning over with care as they brown. Drain
in a hot colander.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Slaw.</span></h3>

<p>Chop or shred a small white cabbage. Prepare a dressing
in the proportion of one tablespoonful of oil to four
of vinegar, a teaspoonful of made mustard, the same
quantity of salt and sugar, and half as much pepper.
Pour over the salad, adding, if you choose, three tablespoonfuls
of minced celery; toss up well and put into a
glass bowl.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brown Betty.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups chopped apples, tart ones.</li>
<li>½ cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 cup of bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put a layer of chopped apple in the bottom of a
buttered pudding-dish. Sprinkle well with sugar, stick
bits of butter here and there and add a pinch or two of
nutmeg. Cover with bread-crumbs, then more apple.
In this order of alternation fill the dish, spreading the
surface with bread-crumbs. Cover, steam nearly an hour
in a moderate oven; then brown quickly.</p>

<p>For sauce, mix a teaspoonful of cinnamon with a cup
of powdered sugar. Butter the hot “Betty” as you fill
each saucer, and strew with this mixture. Or it is excellent,
eaten warm, not hot, with cream and sugar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 dozen mealy potatoes.</li>
<li>1 can of tomatoes.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>3 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of butter, cut into bits and rolled in flour.</li>
<li>1 bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>1 lump of white sugar.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
<li>Fried bread.</li>
</ul>

<p>Parboil the potatoes; then slice and put them into the
soup-pot with the tomatoes, the onions, minced, and the
celery and herbs chopped small. Pour on three quarts
of water, and stew for one hour, or until the vegetables
can be rubbed easily through the colander. Strain, return
to the pot, drop in the sugar, pepper and salt judiciously,
boil up and skim. Stir in the butter, and simmer,
covered, for ten minutes. Have dice of fried bread in the
tureen, upon which pour the soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Oysters.</span></h3>

<p>Select for this the finest oysters. Drain, and wipe
them by spreading them upon a cloth, laying another
over them, and pressing lightly. Roll each in beaten
egg, then in cracker-crumbs with which have been mixed
a little salt and less pepper, and fry in a mixture of equal
parts of lard and butter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Drain each in a wire spoon, and eat them hot, with
bread and butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Wash the meat well and wipe with a clean cloth. Put
into the dripping-pan, pour a cup of boiling water over it,
and roast, basting often, for a while, with salt and water,
afterwards with its own gravy. Allow twelve minutes to
each pound of meat, and keep the fire at a steady, moderate
heat. Should it brown too fast, cover with a sheet
of paper. Take up the meat, put it on a hot dish;
thicken the gravy with browned flour, having first taken
off <i>all</i> the fat you can—season with pepper and salt, boil
up, skim and serve. Pass currant jelly with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach à la Crème.</span></h3>

<p>Pick over and wash the spinach, and cut the leaves
from the stalks. Boil in hot water, a little salted, about
twenty minutes. Drain, put into a wooden tray, or upon
a board; chop <i>very</i> fine, and rub through a colander.
Put into a saucepan; stir until it begins to smoke throughout.
Add then two tablespoonfuls of butter for a good-sized
dish, a teaspoonful of white sugar, three tablespoonfuls
of milk, salt and pepper to liking. <i>Beat</i>, as it heats,
with a silver fork or wire spoon. Some put in a little
nutmeg, and most people like it. Cook thus until it
begins to bubble up as you beat it. Pour into a deep
dish, surround with sliced egg, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes Stewed Whole.</span></h3>

<p>Pare the potatoes and boil in water which was cold
when they went in. When they are done, as is proved
by piercing the largest with a fork, turn off the water, and
cover them barely with milk already heated. Stew in
this five minutes; take the potatoes out, and put into a
covered deep dish. Add to the milk in the saucepan a
good lump of butter, rolled in flour, some chopped
parsley, pepper and salt. Boil up once. Crack each
potato as it lies in the dish, by pressing with the back of
a spoon; pour the hot milk over them; let them stand
three minutes in it, and send to table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">French Tapioca Custard.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>5 dessertspoonfuls of tapioca.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>1 pint of cold water.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of vanilla.</li>
<li>1 heaping cup of sugar.</li>
<li>A pinch of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the tapioca in the water five hours. Heat the
milk to scalding; add the tapioca, the water in which it
was soaked, and the salt. Stir to boiling, and pour gradually
upon the yolks and sugar, which should have been
beaten together. Boil again, stirring constantly, about
five minutes, or until it begins to thicken well. Turn
into a bowl and stir gently into the custard the frothed
whites and the flavoring. Eat cold.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Old Hare Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 hare, or rabbit, full grown.</li>
<li>The bones from yesterday’s mutton broken up well.</li>
<li>A slice of corned ham, or some bones of salt pork.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>Chopped parsley.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of mushroom or walnut catsup.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Clean the hare carefully and cut to pieces, cracking all
the bones. Put into the soup-kettle with the mutton
bones, the bacon, onion, and parsley. Pour on three
quarts of cold water; put on the lid tightly, and stew
four hours very slowly. By this time the meat should be
in shreds. Strain it, return to the fire, season it, stew and
skim five minutes. Slice three boiled eggs and put into
the tureen and pour the soup over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hot Pot.</span></h3>

<p>Put into a deep bake-dish a layer of cold mutton left from
your roast, freed from fat and skin and cut into strips two
inches long by one wide. Overlay these with slices of
<i>parboiled</i> potatoes, a little minced onion, an oyster or
two chopped, some tiny bits of butter, with salt and
pepper. Repeat this process until your meat is used up.
The top layer should be potatoes. Add a cupful of
gravy from Friday’s dinner (or elsewhere), cover very
closely and bake one hour before lifting the lid. Peep in
to see if the contents are done—they will be if your fire
is tolerably strong. Turn out into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cucumber Pickles</span></h3>

<p>Are a better condiment for this dish than any others.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Turnips with White Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and quarter your turnips. Leave in cold water
half an hour. Put on in hot water, and boil until tender.
Drain and cover with a sauce prepared by heating a cup
of milk, thickening it with a heaping teaspoonful of corn-starch,
and stirring in a great spoonful of butter with pepper
and salt to season it well. Put this, when you have
added the turnips, into a vessel set within another of
boiling water, and let them stand covered, without cooking,
ten minutes before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Rice au Genève.</span></h3>

<p>Pick over and wash the rice, and boil in a farina-kettle,
with enough cold water, a little salted, to cover it an inch
deep. Shake now and then as the rice swells. Take from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
your hare soup, when you have strained it, a cupful of
the liquor and about half as much of the boiled shreds of
meat. Chop these extremely fine, season with salt and
pepper. Heat the cup of liquor to a boil, stir into it a
scant tablespoonful of browned flour, then the chopped
meat and a tablespoonful of butter, and stew gently five
minutes. Pile the boiled rice, which should be almost
dry, in a dish, and pour the gravy over it. It is very
savory, and makes a pleasant variety in the list of winter
vegetables.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cabinet Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ lb. of prepared flour.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of butter.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>½ lb. of sugar.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of raisins seeded and cut into three pieces each.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of currants, washed and dried.</li>
<li>½ cup of milk.</li>
<li>½ lemon, grated peel and juice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream the butter and sugar; add the beaten yolks;
the milk and the flour alternately with the whites. Lastly,
stir in the fruit, well dredged with flour; beat up thoroughly,
pour into a buttered mould; put into a pot of
boiling water and do not let it relax its boil for two hours
and a half. Dip the mould into cold water for one moment
before turning it out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cabinet Pudding Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Yolks of 2 eggs, whipped very light.</li>
<li>1 lemon, juice and half the grated peel.</li>
<li>1 glass of wine.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of cinnamon.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the butter into the sugar; add the yolks, lemon,
and spice. Beat five minutes and put in the wine, stirring
hard. Set within a saucepan of boiling water, and stir
until it is scalding hot. Do not let it boil. Pour over
the pudding.</p>

<h2>FEBRUARY.</h2>



<div class="menu">

Clear Vermicelli Soup.<br />
Stewed Ducks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fried Apples and Bacon.<br />
Mashed Carrots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Potatoes à la Reine.<br />
Potato Pie.<br />
——<br />
Oranges and Bananas.<br />
——<br />
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Clear Vermicelli Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 lbs. of veal—the knuckle is best.</li>
<li>1 lb. of lean ham, cut fine.</li>
<li>1 bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of vermicelli.</li>
<li>5 quarts of water.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt with half a teaspoonful ground mace.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat from the bones in thin shreds, and crack
the bones to splinters. Mince the ham and herbs. Put
into a soup-kettle, add the water, cover very tightly with
a weight upon the lid, and stand where it will slowly boil,
for five hours. Then turn into a jar, salt and pepper, and
shut up while hot. Leave the jar all Saturday night upon
the side of the range, where it will keep warm until morning.
Pour into a bowl before breakfast and let it get cold.
Take off the cake of fat two hours before dinner, turn the
soup-jelly, bones and all, into the soup-pot, and when it is
melted strain through your wire sieve. Put in the mace,
boil for an hour and a half, and skim. Put the vermicelli,
already broken into short bits and boiled tender, into the
tureen (but not the water in which it was boiled) and
strain the soup over it through double tarlatan. Let it
stand ten minutes before serving. This is a showy soup,
and easily made, really requiring little attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Ducks.</span></h3>

<p>On Saturday, draw, wash, and stuff your ducks, adding
a touch of onion and sage to the dressing. On Saturday,
also, make a gravy of the giblets, cut small, an onion,
sliced, with a pint of water. Stew, closely covered, for
two hours; take off, season, and set away with the giblets
in it still. Next day—on Sunday—lay the ducks in the
dripping-pan, put in the gravy, adding water if there is not
enough to half cover the fowls, at least. Invert another
pan of the same size over them, and let them stew, at a
moderate heat, for two hours. Or, you can put them into
a large saucepan, pour in the gravy, fit on the lid, and
cook upon the range for the same time. In either case
they will take care of themselves, as will the soup, if
Bridget be reasonably obedient to orders, while you go
to church. When the ducks are done, lay them upon a
hot dish, thicken the gravy with browned flour, add a
glass of brown sherry and the juice of a lemon. Lay
three-cornered bits of fried bread around the inside of the
dish, and pour the gravy over all.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Apples and Bacon.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, core, and slice round, some well-flavored pippins,
or greenings. Cut into thin slices some streaked middling
of excellent bacon, and fry in their own fat almost to crispness.
Take out the meat and arrange it upon a hot chafing-dish,
while you fry the apples in the fat left in the pan
from the bacon. Drain and lay upon the slices of meat.</p>

<p>This is a Southern dish, and not so homely as it would
seem from the mere reading.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Reine.</span></h3>

<p>Mash as usual, beating up light with butter and milk,
but not so soft as not to take any shape you like to give
them. Make a rounded hillock, or a four-sided pyramid
of them upon a flat dish. Brush this all over with beaten
yolk of egg, set in the oven a few minutes to harden the
coating, and send to table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Carrots.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape, wash, lay in cold water half an hour; then
cook tender in boiling water. Drain well, mash with a
wooden spoon, or beetle, work in a good piece of butter,
and season with pepper and salt. Heap up in a vegetable
dish, and serve very hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Pie.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 lb. mashed potato, rubbed through a colander.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of butter, creamed with the sugar.</li>
<li>6 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
<li>1 lemon, squeezed into the potato while hot.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of nutmeg and the same of mace.</li>
<li>2 cups of white sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream the butter and sugar; add the yolks, the spice,
and beat in the potato gradually until it is very light. At
last, whip in the whites. Bake in open shells of paste.
Eat cold.</p>

<p>When making these pies on Saturday—forecasting Monday’s
needs and superabundance of cares—prepare more
pastry than you need for the two large pies which the
above quantity of potato mixture will fill, and set aside a
trim roll of raw crust to be rolled out in due time—we
shall see to what end. I take it for granted (once more)
that all of Sunday’s receipts will be diligently conned on
the day when the old distich tells us, even “lazy people
work the best.”</p>

<p>This potato pie will be pronounced delicious.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oranges and Bananas.</span></h3>

<p>These will make a pretty finish to what I flatter myself
with the hope that you will find a good, and not inelegant
repast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Blanche’s Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Strain out the vermicelli left in yesterday’s “stock.”
Heat very hot, and add two cups of milk in which has
been stirred a tablespoonful of rice-flour, or, if you cannot
get that, corn-starch. Stir until it thickens; take out a
cupful and pour it over two beaten eggs. Return to the
soup, taste, and supply what seasoning is needed; lift
from the fire and leave covered five minutes before pouring
into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Duck Paté.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the meat from the bones of yesterday’s ducks, in
season to make gravy. Do this by breaking the skeletons
to pieces, and putting them, with the stuffing, into a
saucepan, pouring in a quart of cold water, and letting it
in two hours boil down to half as much, or even one-third.
Boil slowly, with the lid slightly lifted after the
boiling begins. Let this get cold; skim and season. In
the bottom of a pudding-dish put some neat slices of duck;
on this a layer of boiled egg sliced thin; then, a few
slices of corned tongue. (That of a calf will do as well
as beef, and be cheaper. It should be boiled and cold.)
Sprinkle each layer with pepper and a little salt, with a
tiny pinch of mace upon the tongue. When your materials
are used up, pour in the gravy, and, just before it
goes into the oven, cover with a crust of pastry kept over
from Saturday. Bake about three-quarters of an hour for
a large dish—half an hour for one of medium size. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
must be a slit in the centre of the crust to let out the
steam.</p>

<p>By proper foresight, the manufacture of this very palatable
pie will consume but little of a busy woman’s time
on Monday. Do not forget that with gravies and soups,
after you have placed them over the fire in a well-chosen
location, they will need nothing more than a hasty glance
for, perhaps, several hours, during which much work in
other parts of the household can be done.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes, Boiled.</span></h3>

<p>It is poor economy, in buying sweet or Irish potatoes,
to get either very large or very small ones. So, in cooking,
select those of uniform size. Put on in hot water;
boil until a fork will go easily into the largest. Peel
quickly and set in the oven for a few minutes to dry. Eat
hot, with butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Succotash.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 can of sweet corn.</li>
<li>1 can of string beans.</li>
<li>1 great spoonful of butter.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>A little flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the beans into inch lengths; put them into a saucepan
with the corn, and cover with cold water. Stew half
an hour, after they begin to cook, turn off most of the
water and put in the milk—cold. When it is hot, stir in
the butter, rolled in flour. Season, simmer for five minutes,
and pour into a deep dish.</p>

<p>This will make a large quantity of succotash for a small
family, but what is not eaten will be nice warmed over for
breakfast.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cup Custards—Boiled.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>Yolks of 5 eggs and whites of 3 (reserving 2 for the <i>méringue</i>).</li>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>Vanilla flavoring, 1 teaspoonful to the pint.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Heat the milk almost to boiling. Take out a cupful
and add, slowly, to the beaten yolks and sugar, whipped
up with three of the whites. Return to the fire and stir
until it begins to thicken, but not until it curdles. Pour
into a bowl and, when cold, flavor. Fill glass, or china
cups with it. Whip the reserved whites to a <i>méringue</i>
with a little powdered sugar, and heap a spoonful upon
the top of each cup.</p>

<p>Watch your opportunity for boiling the custard. I have
often slipped into the kitchen and made it while the coffee
was boiling for breakfast. This once off the fire, no more
cooking is needed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cut, or Fancy Cake,</span></h3>

<p>Of which every housewife keeps a supply in her pantry,
for luncheon and tea, makes, with these custards, a nice
dessert, to which you need never be ashamed to seat John
and his friends.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Family Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. fresh beef bones, broken small.</li>
<li>1 lb. calf’s liver, sliced.</li>
<li>1 slice of ham, minced.</li>
<li>1 lb. of coarse mutton, also minced.</li>
<li>1 turnip.</li>
<li>3 stalks of celery.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>1 onion.</li>
<li>Bunch sweet herbs.</li>
<li>¼ cup of raw rice.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>4 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the cracked bones, the meat, and the chopped
vegetables into the soup-pot, and cover with the water.
The liver should lie in salted water one hour before it is
sliced. Stew very slowly five hours. Then strain, rubbing
hard; cool enough to bring the fat to the top. Take
it off, season the soup, put over the fire, and when it
boils stir in the rice, previously cooked soft in a little
salted water. Simmer together half an hour, and pour
out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rolled Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Get a fillet of beef—that is, the tenderloin of several
steaks cut in one piece. It will not be cheap, but there
will be no waste. Therefore, as one weighing four or five
pounds will make a roast for one day, your dinner will
not be really expensive. Roll it up round; pin tightly
with skewers not to be removed, except by the carver,
and roast with care, basting often that it may not dry up.
Carve horizontally.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Browned Potatoes—Whole.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and parboil some fine potatoes, and half an hour
before your beef is taken up, lay them in the dripping-pan.
Baste with the meat and turn several times. Drain
off the grease when they are done to a fine brown, and
lay about the meat in the dish when it goes to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of tomatoes, and turn into a bowl. After
an hour, season them with a teaspoonful of sugar, half as
much salt, a little pepper and a tablespoonful of butter
cut into bits, each bit rolled in flour and all distributed
evenly throughout the tomatoes. Cover with very dry
bread-crumbs. Bake in a pudding-dish, covered, about
thirty minutes, then brown on the upper grating of the
oven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Make this on Saturday, by stewing sliced tart apples
in a little water until soft, draining and mashing them,
adding a bit of butter while doing this. Sweeten abundantly
and season with nutmeg.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Unity Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>1 egg.</li>
<li>1 <i>generous</i> pint of prepared flour.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub butter and sugar together; beat in the egg, and
whip up very light. Then, milk and salt, finally the flour.
Bake in a buttered mould, until a straw thrust into the
thickest part comes out clean. Turn out upon a plate.
Cut in slices and eat hot.</p>

<p>If for this and other receipts which prescribe prepared
flour, you cannot conveniently procure it, add one teaspoonful
of soda and two of cream of tartar to each quart
of flour. Sift all several times through a sieve. You
can keep this for a week or two in a dry place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups rich milk—half cream, if you can get it.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>Whites of 2 eggs whipped stiff.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful extract of bitter almonds.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of nutmeg.</li>
<li>1 <i>even</i> tablespoonful of corn-starch wet up with cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk to scalding; add the sugar, stir in the
corn-starch. When it thickens beat in the stiffened
whites, then the seasoning. Take from the fire, and set
in boiling water to keep warm—but not cook—until
wanted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Split Pea Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of split peas, soaked in soft water all night.</li>
<li>1 lb. streaked salt pork, cut into thin strips.</li>
<li>2 lbs. of beef bones, cracked well.</li>
<li>3 stalks of celery, and 1 onion, chopped.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>4 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>A sliced lemon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put soaked peas, pork, bones and vegetables over
the fire, with the water, and boil slowly for three hours,
until the liquid is reduced nearly one half. Strain through
a colander, rubbing the peas into a tolerably thick <i>purée</i>
into the vessel below. Season, simmer ten minutes over
the fire, and pour over the lemon, sliced and pared and
laid in the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Chicken—Brown.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pair of chickens.</li>
<li>½ lb. salt pork, minced.</li>
<li>1 small onion.</li>
<li>Tablespoonful of chopped parsley.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>Browned flour.</li>
<li>Pepper, and a little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Joint the chickens, cutting them with a sharp knife.
Put, with the pork, into a pot with a quart of water, and
stew until tender. Do not boil fast, especially at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>.
Strain off the liquor and cover the chickens while you
prepare the gravy. Put it into a large frying-pan. There
will not be too much after the chickens are taken out of
it. Add to it the parsley and chopped onion, with seasoning.
Boil up, thicken with browned flour; stir in the
butter and cook rapidly, stirring often, ten minutes. Arrange
the chickens upon a hot dish and pour the gravy
over it. Let all stand for five minutes before sending to
the table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ladies’ Cabbage.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 firm white cabbage, boiled and left to get cold.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of rich milk.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the cabbage in two waters. When it is cold, chop
fine, and mix with it the beaten eggs, butter, milk, pepper
and salt to your liking. Beat up well and bake in a
buttered pudding-dish until brown. Serve in the dish in
which it was cooked, and eat hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Select large, fair potatoes of equal size, wash, wipe and
put into the oven to bake until soft all through. Send to
table wrapped in a napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Salsify.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape and drop into cold water as fast as you clean
them. Cut into inch lengths; cover with hot water and
stew tender. Turn off the water; put in a cupful of cold
milk. Stew in this ten minutes after the boil begins;
add a lump of butter rolled thickly in flour; pepper and
salt as you fancy. Boil up once and pour into a deep
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soft Gingerbread.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of butter.</li>
<li>1 cup of molasses.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 cup of sour or butter milk.</li>
<li>½ lb. of raisins, seeded and cut in half.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in boiling water.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of cinnamon.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>Nearly 5 cups of sifted flour, enough for tolerably thick batter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream butter, sugar, molasses, and spice; set the mixture
on the range until lukewarm. Add the milk, then
the beaten eggs, the soda, and at last the flour. Beat
<i>hard</i> five minutes; put in the fruit dredged with flour;
beat three minutes, and bake in small round tins.</p>

<p>Eat warm all that is needed for dessert. The rest will
keep well. This gingerbread is uncommonly fine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Café au Lait.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups strong <i>made</i> coffee—fresh and hot.</li>
<li>2 cups of boiling milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strain the coffee from the boiler into the table coffee-pot,
through thin muslin. Add the boiling milk and set
in a vessel of hot water, a “cozey,” or a thick cloth
wrapped about it, for five minutes. Then it is ready for
use. Pass with the gingerbread.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dundee Broth.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of mutton cut into strips.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>2 lbs. of bones cracked.</li>
<li>1 carrot.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>Bunch of herbs.</li>
<li>Handful of chopped cabbage.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of barley.</li>
<li>4 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put on the meat, bones, and sweet herbs, to stew in
four quarts of water. Do not disturb for four hours.
Meanwhile, pare and cut the vegetables into dice, and
boil until tender in just enough water to cover them.
Drain this off and throw it away. Cover the vegetables
with cold water, a little salt, and let them stand until
you have strained the soup. This should be allowed to
cool to throw up the fat. Skim it with care; put back
over the fire. Salt and pepper, boil up, and skim again
before putting in the vegetables, <i>without</i> the water in
which they have been standing. The barley should, all
this time, be soaking in warm water, just deep enough to
cover it. Turn it now, with the water in which it has lain,
into the soup. Let all simmer together one hour, and
serve the vegetables in the soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Calf’s Head.</span></h3>

<p>Take out the brains and set aside. Wash the head
carefully. It should, of course, be cleaned with the skin
on. Soak it in cold, salted water, one hour, then in hot
water ten minutes. Boil in three quarts of cold water
for about an hour after the water begins to bubble.
Take it out, saving the liquor when you have salted it,
as stock for to-morrow’s soup. Plunge the head into
cold water for five minutes. Wipe carefully, put into
your dripping-pan, brush it over with beaten egg, sprinkle
with bread-crumbs, and bake until nicely browned,
basting three times with butter. Make a gravy of a cupful
of the liquor, seasoned and thickened. Fry strips of
ham, about an inch wide by four inches long, almost crisp
in their own fat, and having laid the head upon a flat dish,
dispose these about it. Serve a piece with each plate of
the head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">French Beans and Fried Brains.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of string-beans one hour at least before
they are to be cooked. Cut into short pieces, cover with
hot water, and stew thirty minutes, but not until they
break. Drain well; stir into them two tablespoonfuls of
melted butter, in which have been mixed salt, pepper,
and a tablespoonful of lemon-juice. Heap within a deep
dish, and garnish with the brains.</p>

<p>Wash the brains and lay in cold salt and water for an
hour, then boil ten minutes. Leave in very cold water
until firm—say a quarter of an hour. Wipe, and chop
fine, add a little parsley, pepper and salt; make into
small cakes by flouring your hands; dip in beaten egg,
then in cracker-crumbs, and fry in hot dripping. Drain
thoroughly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Season a can of tomatoes with salt, pepper, sugar, and
a little chopped onion. Stew for twenty-five minutes and
stir in a large tablespoonful of butter. Simmer ten minutes,
and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes in Cases.</span></h3>

<p>Roast large potatoes. Cut off a piece from the top of
each, and lay it aside. Empty the insides carefully by
the help of a small spoon—not tearing the skins. To
this potato, when mashed, add butter, grated cheese, pepper
and salt, as suits your taste. Bind the mixture with
a beaten egg; heat in a saucepan, stirring to prevent
scorching; refill the cases, fit on the top of each, and set
in a hot oven three minutes before sending to table in a
warm napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Snowballs.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>¼ lb. raw rice.</li>
<li>1 quart fresh milk.</li>
<li>5 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>A little nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash the rice in several waters, and boil in the milk
(always in a farina-kettle), adding a little salt and five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
tablespoonfuls of sugar, with a pinch of nutmeg. Stew
gently until the rice is soft and has soaked up the milk.
Fill small cups with the rice, pressing it down firmly, and
let it get cold. At dinner-time, turn it out upon a large
flat dish, or pile within a glass bowl. Eat with sweetened
cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Cream.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of cream.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of rose-water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir the sugar into the cream until it is dissolved; then
the rose-water.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Feet Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 calf’s feet.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>2 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>4 cloves.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 quart of cold water, and the liquor in which the calf’s head was boiled, yesterday.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>In bespeaking your calf’s head from your butcher, ask
also for four nice feet, already cleaned. (You can secure
your sweetbreads at the same time.) Put on the feet in
a quart of cold water. Cover closely and heat gradually
to a very gentle boil. Keep this up until the feet begin
to shrink from the bones—about two hours. Should the
water fall perceptibly, fill up from the tea-kettle. Have
ready the vegetables, herbs, and spice, the former cut up
small. Put them into the liquor left from yesterday’s
head, and when you have heated this to a boil, add the
feet with the water in which they are cooking. Boil for
another hour, still slowly. Strain the soup, cool to make
the grease rise. Skim, season, and return to the fire.
When again boiling, stir in the milk, and the meat from
the feet, cut into dice. Take out a cupful of the soup
and pour, by degrees, over the beaten eggs. Return to
the pot, stir two minutes, and serve.</p>

<p>A very nice soup, and nutritious. If you cannot get
calf’s feet, use those of a pig instead, cooking exactly in
the same way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salt Mackerel, with Cream Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Soak overnight in lukewarm water, changing this in
the morning for ice-cold. Rub all the salt off, and wipe
dry. Grease your gridiron with butter, and rub the fish
on both sides with the same, melted. Then broil quickly
over a clear fire, turning with a cake-turner so as not to
break it. Lay upon a hot-water dish, and cover until the
sauce is ready.</p>

<p>Heat a small cup of milk to scalding. Stir into it a
teaspoonful of corn-starch, wet up with a little water.
When this thickens, add two tablespoonfuls of butter,
pepper, salt, and chopped parsley. Beat an egg light,
pour the sauce gradually over it, put the mixture again
over the fire, and stir one minute, not more. Pour upon
the fish, and let all stand, covered, over the hot water
in the chafing-dish. Put fresh boiling water under the
dish before sending to table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes,</span></h3>

<p>Beaten light with milk and butter, and smoothed into a
mound, should be served with the fish. If you have a
pretty butter-print, wet it, and stamp the top of the
mound.</p>

<p>Remember that <i>everything tastes better for looking
well</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Sweetbreads, Stewed.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 or 4 fine sweetbreads.</li>
<li>¼ lb. fat salt pork, cut into “lardoons,” or long narrow strips.</li>
<li>1 cup of gravy (saved from the roast calf’s head of yesterday).</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of tomato or other catsup.</li>
<li>Juice of half a lemon.</li>
<li>Season with pepper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Parboil the sweetbreads for five minutes. The water
should boil when they are dropped in. Take out and lay
at once in ice-cold water. This makes them firm.
Leave in this five minutes, wipe dry, and set aside to get
cold. Then lard with the strips of pork, passing them
quite through, so as to project on both sides. If you
have no larding-needle, use a long-bladed penknife. Put
them into a saucepan; cover with the gravy. If there
is not enough, put in a few spoonfuls from the boiling
soup. The gravy should be cold, however, when poured
over the sweetbreads. Stew about twenty-five minutes
after the boil begins. Take out the sweetbreads; thicken
the gravy with browned flour, add catsup, lemon, and pepper,
the lardoons having salted it sufficiently. Lay the
sweetbreads upon a hot dish, pour the gravy over them,
and serve; in carving, cut perpendicularly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Celery.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 bunches of celery, the white stalks only, scraped and cut into short pieces.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and a pinch of nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stew the celery in a little salted hot water until quite
tender. Drain off the water and put in the milk, cold.
So soon as it boils, stir in the butter, rolled in flour, pepper,
salt, and nutmeg. Add a few spoonfuls of the hot
milk to the beaten eggs that they may not curdle in the
saucepan; put with the celery and sauce over the fire;
boil up once, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Omelette Soufflé.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>8 eggs.</li>
<li>5 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>Vanilla or rose-water flavoring.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whip the whites to a very stiff froth, thick enough to be
cut with a knife. Beat the yolks smooth and long; add to
these the sugar, whip up well, and flavor. Grease a neat
pudding-dish <i>abundantly</i> with the tablespoonful of butter.
The last thing before you take your seat at the table, do
all this; stir whites and yolks together, and put into a
steady, not <i>too</i> hot, oven. If you have a teachable cook,
let her learn how to put the prepared ingredients together
after dinner has gone in. The oven-door should be
opened as seldom as possible, certainly not under fifteen
minutes. By this time the omelette should have risen
high, and be of a golden brown. Partly close the oven-door,
to keep it hot, and let it be served as soon as possible
in the bake-dish.</p>

<p>Never attempt this or any other nerve-trying dish, for the
first time, for others than a family party. Yet it is easy
enough when you have once learned for yourself how long
to cook it, and how soon it will fall.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tea and Toasted Crackers.</span></h3>

<p>Split Boston crackers, toast, butter; put where they will
keep hot, and pass with an after-dinner cup of tea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gravy and Sago Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 lbs. coarse beef, cut into strips.</li>
<li>3 lbs. of bones.</li>
<li>1 slice of lean corned ham.</li>
<li>4 onions.</li>
<li>4 cloves.</li>
<li>1 bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of German sago.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>5 quarts of water.</li>
<li>2 stalks of celery, cut small.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the beef into narrow strips, the onions into slices.
Fry the latter brown in dripping, strain them out, and set
aside. Return the dripping to the pan, and fry the meat
until it is nicely browned, but not crisp. Lastly, fry the
bones in the same fat. They should be broken up small.
Put meat, bones, celery, spice, and onions into a pot with
a quart of cold water; cover closely, and put where it will
not boil under an hour, but will heat all the time. This
is to draw out color and open the pores (so to speak) of
the meat. So soon as it boils add four quarts more of
cold water. Set where it will boil steadily, but never fast,
for five hours. Strain, and cool sufficiently to make the
fat rise. Take it off, put back over the fire, season, boil
up and skim; put in the sago, which should have been
soaked two hours in a little water, simmer fifteen minutes
and serve.</p>

<p>Save all that is left from dinner, for Monday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Corned Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Wash well, and put over the fire in hot water—plenty
of it—and boil twenty minutes for each pound of meat.
Turn three times while cooking. Drain dry, and serve
with drawn butter in a boat. “Draw” the butter in liquor
taken from the pot. Keep the rest of the liquor for
the base of Sunday’s soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, quarter, and lay in cold water half an hour. Put
on in boiling water, and cook until tender. Drain, mash,
and press to get out the water, work in pepper, salt, and
a generous lump of butter. Do all this quickly not to
cool the turnips, and pile smoothly in a hot, deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower, with Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Pick off the leaves and cut the stem close. Do not cut
the cauliflower unless very large. Lay in cold water for
thirty minutes, tie in coarse bobbinet lace or mosquito
net, and cook in boiling water, slightly salted, until tender.
Lay the cauliflower, flower upward, within a hot dish, and
pour the sauce over it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sauce for the above.</span></h3>

<p>Stir into a cup of boiling water a tablespoonful of flour,
wet up with cold. When it has boiled two minutes, add
two tablespoonfuls of butter, the white of an egg whipped
stiff, pepper and salt, and the juice of a lemon. Boil one
minute, and pour over the cauliflower.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Macaroni.</span></h3>

<p>Break half a pound of macaroni into pieces an inch
long, and cook in boiling water, slightly salted, twenty
minutes. Drain, and put a layer in the bottom of a greased
bake-dish, upon this some grated cheese—Parmesan, if you
can get it—and tiny bits of butter. Then more macaroni,
and so on, filling the dish, with grated cheese on top.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Wet with a little milk, and salt lightly. Bake, covered
half an hour, then brown. Serve in the bake-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jelly Tartlets.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 lb. of flour.</li>
<li>½ lb. of butter.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of lard.</li>
<li>Yolk of an egg.</li>
<li>Ice-water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash the butter in three waters, working it over well
to get out the salt. Melt it in a tin cup set in boiling
water, take the scum from the top, and let it get almost
cold, when beat, little by little, into the whipped egg.
Work these into the flour, adding just enough ice-water to
make the paste soft enough to roll out. When you have
rolled it into a thin sheet, spread all over with the lard,
put on with a knife. Sprinkle lightly with flour, roll up,
and flatten with three or four strokes of the rolling-pin.
Roll again into a yet thinner sheet; again lubricate with
the lard and sprinkle with flour, and, once more, make
into a tight roll. Set for an hour in a cold place. Cut in
two. Set aside enough for your Monday’s dessert; line
small “patty-pans” with the rest, pricking the paste on
the bottom to keep it from puffing too high. Bake in a
quick oven, and when cold put a tablespoonful of sweet
jelly or jam in each.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apples and Nuts,</span></h3>

<p>Especially the former, are better for very young stomachs
than pastry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle Bean Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of mock turtle soup beans.</li>
<li>2 onions, chopped.</li>
<li>4 stalks of celery, cut small.</li>
<li>Liquor in which the corned beef of yesterday was boiled.</li>
<li>Pepper.</li>
<li>Dice of fried bread.</li>
<li>1 quart of cold water.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the beans overnight. In the morning, pour on a
quart of cold water, and set them where they will heat
for an hour, without burning. Stir up often from the bottom.
At the end of this time add the beef liquor (after
taking off the fat), the onions, and celery. Cook gently
three hours, until the beans are boiled to pieces. Strain,
season, put back into the kettle, boil up, season with pepper,
stir in the butter rolled in flour. Simmer five minutes,
and pour upon the fried bread in the tureen.</p>

<p>If you cannot get the purple “mock turtle soup beans,”
use the common white ones.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Haunch of Venison.</span></h3>

<p>Wash all over with lukewarm vinegar and water; then
rub well with butter or lard to soften the skin. Cover
the top and sides with foolscap paper, well greased, and
coat it with a paste of flour and water, half an inch thick.
Lay over this a large sheet of thin wrapping-paper, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
over this another of stout foolscap. Tie all down in
place by greased pack-thread. The papers should also
be thoroughly greased.</p>

<p>Thus much on Saturday—and set the venison in a very
cold place. Next day, about three hours before it will be
needed, put into the dripping-pan, with two cups of boiling
water in the bottom. Invert another pan over it to
keep in the steam; be sure that the fire is good, and leave
it to itself for an hour. Then see that the paper is not
scorching; wet it all over with hot water and a ladleful
of gravy; cover and let it alone for an hour and a half
more. Remove the papers and paste, and test with a
skewer in the thickest part. If it goes in readily, close
the oven, and let it brown for half an hour. Baste freely
four times with claret and butter; at last dredge with
flour and rub over with butter to make a froth. Take it
up, put upon a hot dish. Skim the gravy left in the
dripping pan, strain it, thicken with browned flour; add
two teaspoonfuls of currant-jelly, a glass of claret, pepper
and salt. Boil up for an instant, and serve in a gravy-boat.
Allow a quarter of an hour to the pound in roasting
venison. The neck can be roasted in the same way
as the haunch.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes—Moulded.</span></h3>

<p>Having mashed and seasoned them as usual, grease
<i>well</i> the inside of a fluted pudding or cake mould, put in
the potato, cover, and set for half an hour in a dripping-pan
half full of boiling water, within a moderate oven.
Then remove the lid, dip, for a moment, the mould in
cold water, and turn the potato out upon a flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>You can get them canned, but they are nearly, if not
quite as good dried. In this case soak them overnight
in soft water. Change this in the morning for fresh, and
put them on to boil in hot water, a little salted. Cook
slowly until soft. Do not boil so fast as to break the
skins. Drain well, stir in a good piece of butter, a little
pepper and salt, and eat very hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes—Browned.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in their skins, peel while hot, and set them in a
quick oven. Glaze presently with butter, repeating the
process, several times, as they brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wine Jelly with Whipped Cream.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 package of Coxe’s gelatine, soaked for two hours in a large cup of cold water.</li>
<li>2 cups of white wine, or pale sherry.</li>
<li>1 lemon, all the juice and half the grated peel.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of bitter almond extract.</li>
<li>2 cups of white sugar.</li>
<li>2 cups of <i>boiling</i> water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put soaked gelatine, lemon, sugar, and flavoring extract
together, and cover closely for half an hour. Pour on
boiling water, stir and strain. Add the wine, strain again
through a flannel bag, without squeezing, and leave in a
mould wet with cold water, until just before the Sunday
dinner.</p>

<p>Whip a cup of rich cream to a thick froth in a syllabub-churn.
The jelly should have been formed in an open
mould—one with cylinder in the middle. Fill the hollow
left by this with the whipped cream; or, if your jelly be
a solid mass, heap the cream about the base.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee and Macaroons</span></h3>

<p>Should be the final course. I make no apology for
hot and good Sunday dinners. There is a vast deal of
straining out infinitesimal gnats and swallowing gigantic
camels upon this, as upon most other questions of conscience.
We have neither time nor space for their discussion.
I have simply tried to deal with the fact that
most husbands, brothers, and fathers expect a better dinner
on Sabbath, and enjoy it more, than upon other days,
by showing, to the best of my ability, how they can be
gratified without imposing heavy duties upon mistress and
servants at a season when both mind and body need comparative
rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">“Second Thoughts” Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Heat Saturday’s soup to a boil; add two cups of
milk, and when this heats, pour a little of it upon two
beaten eggs. Return these to the soup, add whatever
seasoning is necessary; simmer all together for one minute,
and pour upon three or four tablespoonfuls of grated
cheese placed in the bottom of the tureen. Stir up well,
and it is ready.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Venison.</span></h3>

<p>Trim the remains of the roast haunch into a neat shape,
and lard with strips of fat pork, making incisions to receive
it with a thin, sharp-edged knife. Pour what gravy
you have over it, or should there be none, use butter
and water instead. Put into a dripping-pan, turn another
over it and roast—or steam—for one hour. Meantime,
make a gravy of the trimmings, bits of bone, etc., by
covering them well with cold water, and adding half an
onion, sliced. Stew until the gravy is reduced one-half.
Strain, season with pepper; a tablespoonful of currant-jelly,
one of catsup and two of claret. Thicken slightly
with browned flour, boil up to mix well, and pour gradually
over the meat. Baste abundantly with this for half
an hour if the piece of meat be large. Less time may
suffice for a small roast. Never let it dry for an instant.
When done, it should seem to have been stewed rather
than roasted. Serve the gravy in a sauce-boat.</p>

<p>Like some other “second thoughts,” this dish will be
even better than at its first appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Turn nearly all the juice off from a can of tomatoes.
Salt and pepper this, by the way, and put aside in a cool
place for some other day’s soup. Put a layer of bread-crumbs
in the bottom of a buttered pie-dish; on them
one of tomatoes; sprinkle with salt, pepper, and some
bits of butter, also a little sugar. Another layer of
crumbs, another of tomatoes—seasoned—then a top
layer of very fine, dry crumbs. Bake covered until bubbling
hot, and brown quickly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Slice cold ones left from yesterday, or boiled this fore-noon;
roll in flour and fry in dripping. Drain well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raspberry and Currant Jelly Tart.</span></h3>

<p>Roll out the raw paste reserved for to-day from Saturday,
and line two pie-dishes. Fill them nearly full of
canned raspberries, sweetened to your liking. Spread a
coating of currant jelly over the top, and cover with a
lattice-work of pastry, cut with a jagging-iron. Watch
your chance of putting them into the oven, as they are
better when not hot.</p>

<p>You will like them, I think.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clam Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>50 clams, ready opened.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>1 pint of water.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>12 whole peppers.</li>
<li>A few bits of red pepper pods.</li>
<li>6 blades of mace.</li>
<li>Salt to taste.</li>
<li>1 stalk of celery, cut small.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful rice-flour or corn-starch.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drain off the liquor from the clams and put it over the
fire in a large farina-kettle, with a pint of water, the
peppers, mace, celery, and salt. When it has boiled ten
minutes, strain and put back into the kettle with the
clams. Shut the lid down closely, and boil, fast, thirty
minutes. Heat the milk in another vessel, stir into it
the rice-flour, wet up with cold water, and the butter.
Pour into the kettle with the clams, take at once from the
fire, pour into the tureen, in the bottom of which you have
laid four or five Boston crackers, split. Cover, and wait
five minutes before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ragoût of Veal.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>5 lbs. of knuckle of veal.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>2 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>Juice of tomatoes set aside yesterday.</li>
<li>Juice of half a lemon.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of browned flour.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of streaked fat pork.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Crack the bones, when you have taken the meat off,
and put them into a saucepan with the minced onion,
celery, and herbs, with a quart of water. Stew slowly
until the liquor has boiled down to a pint. Meanwhile,
cut the veal into neat slices, and fry until they begin to
brown, in some good dripping. Strain the gravy made
from the bones and vegetables over this, and put all on
to stew, adding the tomato-juice, pepper, and pork, the
last cut up fine. Simmer, with the lid on, for two hours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Then add the browned flour, wet up in cold water, salt,
if needed, the butter and lemon-juice. Boil up once, and
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice and Cheese.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a cup of rice in a quart of water, slightly salted,
and when half-done add two tablespoonfuls of butter.
By the time the rice is soft, the water should have been
soaked up entirely, and each grain stand out whole in the
mass. Never stir boiling rice, but shake up the saucepan
instead. Stir into the rice, at this point, three tablespoonfuls
of grated cheese, salt and pepper to taste. Toss up
with a fork until the cheese is dissolved, and pour into a
deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Puff.</span></h3>

<p>Mash the potatoes while hot. Beat in butter, milk,
and two whipped eggs, with salt to your liking, until you
have a light, soft paste. Bake in a buttered pudding-dish
in a quick oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Celery Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Cut up blanched stalks of celery into short pieces.
Mix a dressing of one tablespoonful of oil to one teaspoonful
of sugar, one of salt, half as much pepper, and
four tablespoonfuls of vinegar with half a teaspoonful of
made mustard. Heat the vinegar to scalding, and pour
over a beaten egg, a little at a time, and beating it in
well. To this add the oil and other ingredients, whipping
up the mixture with an egg-beater. When cold, pour
over the salad, toss up with a silver fork, and put into a
glass bowl.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Mere Trifle.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of fresh milk.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>Vanilla, or other essence, 2 teaspoonfuls.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk to boiling, and pour, gradually, upon the
beaten yolks and sugar. Put again over the fire, stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
steadily for about ten minutes, or until it begins to
thicken. Take it off, and while still very hot, stir in with
a few light strokes half of the frothed whites. Let it get
cold before flavoring it. Pour into a glass bowl. Whip
the remaining whites to a <i>méringue</i> with a little powdered
sugar. Heap upon the custard. Put bits of bright
jelly, or preserved strawberries, here and there upon the
snowy mass.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hotch-Potch.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. of lean beef, without bones, and cut into mince-meat.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>2 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>½ small cabbage, cut fine.</li>
<li>2 potatoes.</li>
<li>1 cup of corn.</li>
<li>Half a can of tomatoes.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs, chopped.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash, scrape, and slice the vegetables, and put all except
the tomatoes into a pot; cover with hot water and
boil gently ten minutes. Drain off the water, put a handful
of the mixed vegetables, including now the tomatoes,
in the bottom of a stone jar. Pepper and salt, strew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
thickly with the minced raw beef, repeat the order until
your materials are all in the jar. Fit a top or a small
plate over the mouth; tie down with stout greased paper,
set it within the oven, and let it alone for five or six hours,
except that you must look, now and then, to see that the
paper does not take fire. Prevent this by greasing it
abundantly. At the end of this time, turn out the hotch-potch;
stir in the butter, and, if needed, additional seasoning
through it, and serve in a tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Pigeons.</span></h3>

<p>Pick, clean, and wash the pigeons, and put into a pot
with a cupful of water to keep them from burning, and a
tablespoonful of butter for each one. Shut the lid down
tightly, and subject to a slow heat until they are of a nice
brown—about nut-color. Once in a great while turn
them, and see that each is well wet with the liquor. Take
them out and cover in a warm place—a colander set over
a pot of hot water is best—while you make the gravy.
Chop the giblets of the pigeon “exceeding small” with
a little onion and parsley. Put into the gravy, pepper
and salt, boil up and thicken with browned flour. Return
the pigeons to the pot, cover again tightly, and cook
slowly until tender. If there should not be liquor enough
in the pot to make the gravy, add boiling water before the
giblets go in.</p>

<p>This is an admirable receipt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Lyonnaise.</span></h3>

<p>Cut parboiled potatoes into dice. Chop an onion and
fry it, with a little minced parsley, in good dripping or
butter, for one minute. Then put in the potatoes.
Stir briskly until they have fried slowly for five minutes.
They must never stick to the bottom, nor brown. Sprinkle
with pepper and salt, drain free of fat by shaking them in
a heated colander, and send up hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kidney Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Soak over night in soft water; next morning cover with
lukewarm, and cook slowly for one hour. Salt slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and boil until tender, but not to actual breaking. Drain
very well, stir in a liberal spoonful of butter, pepper, and
serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">English Tapioca Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of tapioca.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>3 pints of milk.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>½ lb. of raisins.</li>
<li>Half the grated peel of a lemon.</li>
<li>A <i>little</i> salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the tapioca for one hour in a pint of the milk;
pour into a farina-kettle, surround with warm water, salt
very slightly, and bring to a boil. When soft throughout,
turn out to cool, while you make the custard. Heat a
quart of milk to scalding; pour over the beaten eggs and
sugar, this last having been rubbed to a cream with the
butter. Mix with the tapioca—lemon-peel and raisins last.
Dredge the fruit lightly with flour, and beat all up hard.
Bake in a buttered dish one hour—at first covered.</p>

<p>Eat warm, with powdered sugar. It is better for not
being too hot.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Celery Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. of veal.</li>
<li>1 slice of corned ham, or a ham-bone.</li>
<li>2 bunches of celery.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch wet up in water.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of sugar.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>Dice of fried bread.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the meat, onion, and herbs; cover with the water
and put on to stew early in the day. When the meat
has boiled to rags and the liquid reduced one-half, strain,
and put in the celery, cut into small pieces. Use the
best parts only. Stew soft; rub through a colander and
return with the broth to the saucepan. Season, add the
sugar, boil up and skim, and put in the milk. Heat, and
add corn starch. When it again boils, you stirring all the
while, put in the butter.</p>

<p>Take off so soon as this has melted, and pour over the
fried bread in the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Cutlets—Fried.</span></h3>

<p>Beat them flat with the broad side of a hatchet; season
with pepper and salt, dip first in beaten egg, then in
bread-crumbs, and fry in lard or dripping. Drain perfectly
free from the fat, and arrange them, standing on
end and touching one another, around a mound of mashed
potatoes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare as usual, and shape with a knife into a smooth
mound, with a hedge of cutlets about the base.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Corn and Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Take a half-can of tomatoes and the same of corn,
the rest of that which was opened for your “hotch-potch”
yesterday, and, after mixing them up well, season with
pepper, salt, and a little sugar. Set on where they will
cook slowly. At the end of twenty-five minutes, stir in a
great spoonful of butter. Put on the lid and stew <i>very</i>
gently ten minutes more. Serve in a deep dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brussels Sprouts.</span></h3>

<p>Pick over, trim, and lay in cold water for half an hour
cook quickly in boiling water, a little salt, for fifteen minutes.
Drain carefully, put upon a flat dish, and pour drawn
butter over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Méringue Pie.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of flour.</li>
<li>½ lb. of butter.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of lard.</li>
<li>Ice-water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the lard in flour, wet up with ice-water to a stiff
paste. Roll thin, and baste with one-third of the butter,
sprinkle lightly with flour, and roll up. Again roll out,
even thinner than before, baste again with half the remaining
butter, sprinkle with flour, and make a second
roll. Repeat this process yet a third time, and set in a
cold place for one hour.</p>

<p>Cut the roll of paste into two pieces, reserving one for
to-morrow’s oyster-pie. With the other, line two pie-dishes
and fill with good apple-sauce, well sweetened,
and seasoned with nutmeg. Bake until just done. Draw
to the oven door, and spread with a méringue made by
whipping stiff the whites of three eggs for each pie, sweetening
with a tablespoonful of sugar for each egg. Flavor
with a little rose-water or lemon-essence, beat until you
can make a clean cut in it, and spread three-quarters of
an inch thick upon each pie. Shut the oven door until
the méringue is well set. Do not let it scorch. Eat
cold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Friars’ Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 onions.</li>
<li>3 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>¼ of a small cabbage.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>½ cup raw rice.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt to taste.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of chopped parsley.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the vegetables, all chopped fine (reserving the
parsley for seasoning), in three quarts of water until they
can be pulped through a colander. Return them, with
the water in which they were cooked, to the fire. Boil
the rice, meantime, in a little water until it swells and
absorbs it all. Stir into the vegetable porridge, season,
and simmer for fifteen minutes. Add the butter, simmer
ten minutes, dip out a cupful and beat into the
eggs. Stir this into the broth, and before it begins
to boil, take from the fire and pour out, lest the eggs
should curdle.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Roll out the raw paste made yesterday into a pretty
thick sheet. Fill a pudding-dish with crusts of stale bread,
or light crackers. Butter the edges of the dish that the
crust may be easily removed. Cover the mockpie with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the pastry; lay a strip cut in scallops or points, around the
edge, to keep it in place, and bake.</p>

<p>To each pint of oyster-liquor allow a cup of milk, but
heat them in separate vessels. So soon as the liquor
boils, put in the oysters and cook five minutes more.
Stir a tablespoonful of corn-starch into the pint of hot
milk, having, of course, first wet it up with cold water,
and, when it thickens, pour over the oysters and liquor.
Season with pepper and salt, and add two tablespoonfuls
of butter, if there be a quart of oysters. Lift the hot
crust from the pudding-dish with great care. Remove the
stale bread, wipe out the inside; pour in the stewed
oysters with enough of the soup to cover them well; replace
the pastry and set in the oven for two or three minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Liver à l’Anglaise.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. of fresh liver.</li>
<li>½ lb. fat salt pork.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>½ of a small onion.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley.</li>
<li>Pepper.</li>
<li>The pork should salt it sufficiently.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the butter into a warm—not hot saucepan. Cut
the liver into slices half an inch thick, and lay upon the
butter. Mince the pork and cover the liver. Sprinkle
the parsley and onion, with pepper, on top. Cover the
saucepan closely and set in a kettle of hot water. Keep
this water below the boiling-point for an hour. Then let
it boil another hour. The liver should by this time be
very tender and juicy, if the heat has been properly managed.
Take it out, and put it upon a chafing-dish to keep
warm. Boil up, and thicken the gravy with browned flour;
pour over the liver and serve. The inner saucepan should
be made of tin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes au Gratin.</span></h3>

<p>Mash your potatoes soft with butter and milk; mould
in a round pan or tin jelly-mould, made very wet with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
cold water. Turn out upon a flat plate—a sheet of tin
is better—well-greased, strew with fine, dry bread-crumbs;
set upon the upper grating of the oven to brown quickly.
Slip dexterously from the plate to a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Parsnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil tender and cut in long slices. Heat in a saucepan
a cup of milk, thicken it with a tablespoonful of
butter cut into bits and rolled in flour, season with pepper,
salt, and a little nutmeg. Put in the parsnips, boil
up once gently, take from the fire, and leave covered in
the saucepan for five minutes before you serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Picklette and Apple Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Pass the first with the oyster pie, which is a course of
itself; the apple sauce with the meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Custard.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>4 heaping tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls vanilla extract.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scald the milk, rub the chocolate to a smooth paste in
a little cold milk. Stir into the milk and cook two minutes
in it. Beat up the yolks of the five eggs with the
whites of two, and the sugar. Pour the hot mixture,
gradually, upon them, stirring deeply. Turn into a buttered
pudding-dish, and set in a dripping-pan of boiling
water. Bake until firm. When “set” in the middle,
spread quickly, without taking from the oven, with a <i>méringue</i>
made by whipping the reserved whites stiff with a
very little sugar. Bake until this is done. Eat cold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. knuckle of veal.</li>
<li>2 lbs. of lean beef.</li>
<li>1 lb. lean ham.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>1 carrot.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of macaroni cut into fancy shapes, usually known as “Italian Paste.”</li>
<li>6 cloves.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>6 quarts of water.</li>
<li>3 stalks of celery.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mince the meat, crack the bones, and slice the vegetables.
Mix all together. Put the butter in the bottom
of a soup-pot, next the meat, then the vegetables and
herbs; fit on a tight lid, and set the pot where it will
warm very slowly. At the end of an hour, open it, pour
off the gravy; increase the heat until the meat begins to
brown on the sides of the pot. Return the gravy to the
rest of the ingredients; cover with six quarts of cold
water, and boil until the liquor has fallen to four quarts.
This should be in four hours. Strain the soup; pressing
out all the nourishment, and rubbing the vegetables
through the sieve. Add the paste, or, if you cannot
obtain it, the same quantity of pipe macaroni, boiled a
few minutes in hot water, and left to get cool. Then,
with a sharp knife or scissors, clip it into very short bits,
and put into the soup. Season, boil up, skim well, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
let all cook gently together for ten minutes. Half of the
above quantity of stock will be enough for Saturday’s
dinner. Therefore, before adding the macaroni, take out
about two quarts, season well, and set aside for Sunday’s
soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Soak overnight in warm water. In the morning, scrub
it hard; trim away the rusty part of the under side and
edges; wipe dry; cover the bottom with a stiff paste of
flour and water, and lay, upside down, in the dripping-pan,
with enough water to keep it from burning. Allow,
in baking, twenty-five minutes to the pound. Baste a
few times, to prevent the skin from cracking, and keep
hot water in the pan. When a skewer will pierce the
thickest part, take it up, plunge for one minute into cold
water; skin carefully, brush all over with beaten egg, then
strew very thickly with cracker-crumbs, and set in a hot
oven to brown. Eat hot or cold, garnished with sprigs
of celery or parsley.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Fondu.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pint of boiling milk.</li>
<li>1 cup <i>very</i> dry bread-crumbs. (Crush the crusts baked in yesterday’s oyster pie.)</li>
<li>½ lb. dry cheese, grated.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the hot milk; beat in the cheese;
then the yolks of the eggs, pepper and salt. Have a
buttered pudding-dish ready, and just before the <i>fondu</i>
goes into the oven whip in the whites of the eggs, already
frothed. Pour into the dish, bake in a brisk oven, and
send at once to table, as it soon falls. This is a delightful
accompaniment to ham.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach with Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Pick the leaves from the stems, wash well, and boil in
hot water, a little salted, for twenty minutes. Chop and
drain. Return to the saucepan with a tablespoonful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
butter, a teaspoonful of sugar, a little pepper and salt.
Have ready the yolks of three eggs, rubbed to powder,
then wet up with a little cream or milk. Stir all together
in the saucepan, beating with a wire spoon, until they are
smooth and thick. Turn into a deep dish and garnish
with the whites of the eggs cut into rings.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare the potatoes; cut into quarters, and these into
long, even strips. Lay in cold water half an hour, and
cook in boiling water until tender, with half a minced
onion. Drain off nearly all the water; pepper and salt,
and add a cup of cold milk with a tablespoonful of butter
rolled in flour. When it thickens, stir in a little chopped
parsley. Simmer five minutes and serve. The potatoes

<h3><span class="smcap">Beef and Barley Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Use the two quarts of stock set aside yesterday. Soak
five or six tablespoonfuls of barley in cold water two
hours. Boil half an hour or until tender, in a little salted
water. When you have taken the cake of cold fat from
the top of the soup, put in the barley and simmer all
together half an hour. Then stir in two tablespoonfuls of
shred gelatine previously soaked one hour in cold water.
When this has dissolved, the soup is ready for use.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Steamed Turkey.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare the turkey as for roasting, and, if you have no
steamer, put a gridiron upon the top of a pot of boiling
water; lay the fowl upon it, invert a deep pan, as nearly
as possible the size of the mouth of the pot, over it, stuff
wet cloths into whatever space may be left between the
pot and the pan, and keep the water at a hard boil,
allowing twenty minutes for each pound of turkey. Two
or three times, replenish the water by pulling away one
of the cloths so as to leave an aperture large enough to
admit the nose of the boiling tea-kettle. When the turkey
is half done, lift the pan and turn it; replace the
cloths and steam again. When it is done, lay upon a hot
dish and baste with a mixture of melted butter and
chopped parsley, anointing all parts of it well. Serve
drawn butter in a boat, with a couple of boiled eggs
chopped fine, stirred up in it. Save the giblets of the
turkey for Monday’s soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cranberry Sauce</span></h3>

<p>In a mould, as strained jelly, or the plainer dish of stewed
cranberries, well-sweetened, must accompany this dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Naples Rice Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Take a few tablespoonfuls of the meat boiled in yesterday’s
soup, mince fine, add half a chopped onion,
a tablespoonful of dripping from the top of the soup,
and put on to warm with a very little hot water. Simmer,
but do not boil, fifteen minutes. Boil one cup
of rice in enough water, slightly salt, to cover it well.
Shake up from time to time, but do not stir. When
the rice is soft and has soaked up the water, add a cup of
cold milk in which has been stirred a tablespoonful of
corn-starch, one raw egg, and a tablespoonful of butter.
Take from the fire before you do this and turn into a
bowl. Stir in now the minced meat and gravy (there
should be very little of the latter), season to taste, mix all
up well, and put into a buttered cake-mould. Set this in a
dripping-pan of hot water and bake one hour, closely
covered. Turn out upon a hot dish. It is a very good
<i>entrée</i>, and easily made.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in their skins until soft to the touch; pare quickly,
lay upon a flat dish, butter each, and serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pumpkin Pie.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of stewed pumpkin, rubbed through a fine colander.</li>
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>2 quarts of milk.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of mace.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of cinnamon and the same of nutmeg.</li>
<li>1½ cups of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the eggs light and whip in the sugar, then the
pumpkin and spice. At last, mix in the milk, stirring up
well from the bottom.</p>

<p>Bake in open shells of paste made according to the receipt
given last Thursday. Eat cold, and send around a
plate of cheese with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Giblet Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the giblets of your turkey into six pieces each,
and stew, closely covered, in a pint of water until tender.
Strain out the barley from the remains of yesterday’s soup
and if you have any of Saturday’s in the pantry, strain out
the vermicelli and add that. Warm this to a boil with
the liquor in which the giblets were cooked. Boil up
sharply and skim; add the giblets, and while they simmer
together, put two tablespoonfuls of butter cut into bits,
and rolled in <i>browned</i> flour, into a frying-pan. Stir until
it is hissing hot. Add to the soup with a handful of
chopped parsley, and a tablespoonful of walnut or mushroom
catsup. Boil up once and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Turkey and Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Cover the uncarved side of your steamed turkey with
rather thick and fat slices of cooked ham. Three or four
large ones will suffice. Bind them to the body with
greased packthread. Lay the turkey, cut side downward,
and the ham up, in the dripping-pan with a little boiling
water in the bottom. Bake about three-quarters of an
hour, basting the ham, when it begins to drip, with its own
grease. Ten minutes before taking it up, clip the strings,
and remove the ham to a hot dish. Dredge the upper
side of the turkey with flour, and baste with butter to
make a brown froth. Dish, with the ham laid around it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn Puddings.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Add to a can of sweet corn,</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>3 eggs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>1 of sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat up the eggs, add the sugar and butter, the milk,
corn, and, lastly, the flour. Bake in earthenware cups
well buttered, or in neat patty-pans. Turn out upon a
dish, or eat from the cups. They are very nice when hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, wipe, and bake in a moderate oven. When
done, cut a round piece of skin almost entirely from the
top of each, leaving a “hinge” at one side. With a
small knife make an incision in the mealy part of the
potato, <i>i. e.</i>, the heart, put in a pinch of salt, and a bit of
butter, replace the flap of skin, and send hot to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Farina Custard.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of farina.</li>
<li>3 eggs well beaten.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>Vanilla essence—2 teaspoonfuls.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk to scalding; stir in the farina, which
should have been previously soaked in a little cold water
for an hour. Cook in a farina-kettle fifteen minutes, stirring
often. Take out a cupful and beat into the eggs
already whipped up with the sugar. Put into the kettle,
stir in salt and flavoring, boil two minutes, and pour into
a deep dish. Eat warm, putting a teaspoonful of sweet
fruit jelly upon the top of each saucerful in serving.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Plain Calf’s Head Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Wash a calf’s head (cleaned with the skin on), in three
waters, and soak one hour in salted water. Then put on
to boil in five quarts of cold water. Cook until the
meat slips easily from the bones. Take out the head,
remove the bones, and throw back into the soup. Set
aside three-quarters of the meat—the best portions—for
to-morrow’s dinner. Chop the ears and other refuse parts
fine; season with salt, pepper, onion, sweet marjoram, a
teaspoonful of ground cloves, and as much allspice—even
spoonfuls. Mix all up well, return to the soup and boil
down to three quarts. Mash the brains and make into
force-meat balls with raw egg, seasoning and enough flour
to hold them together; roll in flour and set in a cool
place until wanted. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter into
a saucepan with two tablespoonfuls of browned flour wet
up with cold water, and stir together five minutes. Strain
the soup, put back two quarts over the fire, stir in the
thickening of flour and butter, boil up and put in the
force-meat balls. Simmer ten minutes, add the juice of a
lemon, and a glass of brown sherry, and pour out. The
reserved quart of “stock” is for another day’s soup. Do
not put the calf’s tongue into the soup. It is indispensable
in to-morrow’s ragoût.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>The best part for boiling is the leg. Put on in boiling
water and cook, allowing fifteen minutes to the pound.
Make a sauce by taking out a cupful of liquor when it is
nearly done, cooling it until you can take off the fat,
then heating again in a saucepan and stirring into it one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
tablespoonful of butter, two teaspoonfuls of flour, wet up
with cold water. Stir for five minutes, putting in a teaspoonful
of chopped parsley, and after another boil, take
from the fire before you put in the juice of a lemon.</p>

<p>In this, as in other cases where the liquor in which
meat is boiled is to be used for broth, salt slightly while
cooking, sprinkling all over lightly with salt the moment
you take it from the fire. Serve the sauce in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Minced Cabbage.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a firm head of cabbage, quartered, in two waters,
throwing the first away after ten minutes’ cooking and
putting in more as hot, and a little salted. When it is
tender all through, drain and chop quite fine, seasoning
with salt, pepper, and a liberal portion of butter. Serve
hot in a vegetable dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of string beans an hour before they are to
be used. Cut them into short pieces when you are ready
to cook them; turn off the liquor and cover them with
cold water. Put into a pot with a bit of salt pork a
little more than an inch square. Boil slowly until tender,
strain, season with pepper, and serve hot, with the pork on
top of the pile of beans.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beet-root Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Boil the beets until tender; scrape clean; drop into
cold water for three minutes. Slice, and pour over them
a dressing of vinegar, salt, sugar, made mustard, pepper,
and one tablespoonful of oil to four of vinegar. Cover,
and let all stand together for two hours. This salad will
keep for a couple of days.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-meal Puffs.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of boiling milk.</li>
<li>2 scant cups of white “corn-flour.”</li>
<li>½ cup of wheat-flour.</li>
<li>1 scant cup of powdered sugar.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>A little salt.</li>
<li>4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of soda.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of cream tartar.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sift soda and cream tartar twice through the flour.
Then, mix flour and meal together, and sift a third time.
Boil the milk and stir into it the meal, flour, and salt.
Boil ten minutes, stirring well up from the bottom. Take
it off, put into a bowl, add the butter and beat hard for
three minutes. Let it cool while you whip the eggs light,
then the yolks and sugar and spice together. Beat these
into the cold mush, and lastly the frothed whites. Whip all
together faithfully, and bake in greased cups or small
“corn-bread moulds,” set within a steady oven. When
done, turn out and eat hot, breaking—not cutting—them
open, and after buttering sprinkling with white sugar.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Marie’s Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 sweetbreads.</li>
<li>1 quart of soup jelly, left from yesterday’s stock.</li>
<li>1 quart of cold water.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>Bunch of parsley.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>2 blades of mace.</li>
<li>A dozen mushrooms.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of corn-starch wet up in cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash and scald the sweetbreads, and put on to stew in
the cold water. When they have boiled slowly half an
hour, salt, boil up and skim. Take all the fat from the
top of the cold soup-stock, and stir into the liquor already
on the fire. Add the onion and parsley minced, and the
mace; season to taste, cover and stew gently for one hour.
Take out the sweetbreads and lay them where they will
cool quickly. Strain the soup, return to the fire; put in
a dozen mushrooms (you can buy the French <i>champignons</i>
in cans), stew fifteen minutes; cut the sweetbreads into
small squares, drop into the soup; thicken with the corn-starch
wet with cold water; boil up once and serve.</p>

<p>This soup is very fine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ragoût of Calf’s Head and Mushrooms.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cold boiled calf’s head, cut into slices with the tongue.</li>
<li>1 can French mushrooms, <i>minus</i> those used for the soup.</li>
<li>1 sliced onion.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and sweet herbs.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful mixed mace and allspice.</li>
<li>Juice of a lemon.</li>
<li>Butter or dripping for frying.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut three-quarters of the calf’s head—the best parts—into
neat slices, also the tongue. Chop the rest, season
with the onion, pepper and salt, cover with three cups of
cold water, and stew gently down to one cup of gravy.
Meanwhile fry the slices of meat in good dripping. Take
them out with a wire spoon and put into the bottom of a
tin vessel set within another of warm—not boiling—water.
Cover and set over the fire. Drain, slice and fry the
mushrooms in the fat left in the frying-pan. Drain and
lay these upon the meat in the inner vessel. Time the
cooking of the gravy so as to have it ready, spiced, and
seasoned, to be strained, hot over the meat and mushrooms.
Put on a tight lid and <i>simmer</i> fifteen minutes,
never boiling once. Strain off the gravy into a saucepan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Thicken, and let it boil up once. Add the lemon-juice,
put the meat and mushrooms into a deep dish, and
pour the hot gravy over all.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil soft, drain and mash, pressing the water out well,
return to the saucepan, with a generous lump of butter;
pepper and salt; stir constantly until the butter is dissolved,
and all smoking hot, and serve in a covered dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Creamed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>In mashing them, add more milk than usual, whipping
up hard with a silver fork. While still very hot, beat in
the white of an egg, already frothed stiffly; pile in a deep
dish and set, uncovered, within the oven, until a light
crust begins to form on the top, but not long enough to
injure the dish. Brush over with butter to glaze it, and
serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Soy</span></h3>

<p>Is an excellent “stock” pickle. For directions for making
it, please refer to page 488, “<span class="smcap">General Receipts,
No. 1, of Common-Sense Series</span>.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sponge-cake Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 stale sponge-cake.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>4 eggs, beaten light.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of corn-starch, wet up with cold milk.</li>
<li>Juice of one lemon and half the grated peel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Slice the cake and lay some of it in the bottom of a
buttered pudding-dish. Make a custard by scalding the
milk, stirring into it the corn-starch, then pouring it, by
degrees, upon the beaten eggs and sugar. Add the lemon;
pour over the cake, put another layer of slices; more
custard, and so on, until the mould is full. Put a small,
heavy plate on top, and let all stand until the custard is
soaked up. Cover and bake, half an hour, or until done
throughout. Turn out upon a flat dish, sprinkle thickly
with white sugar, and eat warm or cold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nuts and Raisins.</span></h3>

<p>Crack the nuts, and select for table use fair bunches of
plump, fresh raisins.</p>

——<br />
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potage au Riz,</span></h3>

<p>In plainer English, rice-broth, can be achieved for to-day,
with little trouble, by the help of the liquor in which
your mutton was boiled on Tuesday. Wash and soak
a cup of rice in cold water. At the end of half an hour,
add it, with the water in which it has soaked, to the
mutton-broth, from which you must first take the fat.
Boil very slowly two hours, and should the water sink below
the original level more than an inch, replenish with
boiling. In another saucepan heat a cup of milk, thickened
with a tablespoonful of rice-flour. Season the mutton-broth
with pepper and parsley—it will hardly need
salt. (Boil up and skim, before the parsley goes in.)
Pour the hot milk over two beaten eggs, stir in well; add
to the soup in the kettle, and take instantly from the fire.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">English Pork Pie.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of <i>lean</i> fresh pork, cut into strips as long as your finger.</li>
<li>6 large juicy apples.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and mace to taste.</li>
<li>1 cup of sweet cider.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>Good pie-paste for an upper crust, made according to receipt given for Thursday of second week in this month.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put a layer of pork within a pudding-dish; season with
pepper, salt, and nutmeg, or mace. Next a layer of sliced
apples, strewed with sugar and bits of butter. Go on in
this order until you are ready for the crust, having the
last layer of apples. Pour in the cider, cover with a thick
crust of good pastry, ornamented around the edge; make
a slit in the middle, and bake in a moderate oven one hour
and a half. Should the crust threaten to brown too fast,
cover with paper. When nicely browned, brush over with
butter and close the oven door for a moment; then wash
well with white of egg. Eat hot. You will find it very
good, odd as the receipt may seem.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mock Stewed Oysters.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape and drop into cold water a bunch of salsify, or
oyster-plant. Cut into short pieces and stew tender in
boiling water, a little salted. Drain off nearly all the
water, and pour into the saucepan a cup of cold milk.
When again hot, add a heaping tablespoonful of butter
and a handful of fine cracker-dust, with pepper and salt.
Stir very slowly for five minutes, and pour out. It should
be about as thick as oyster soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Balls.</span></h3>

<p>Mash potatoes with a little butter and salt, and let
them get cold. Then work in a beaten egg. Make into
balls about twice the size of a walnut, with floured hands,
roll them well in flour, and fry yellow-brown in good dripping
or lard. Drain in a colander, and pile upon a flat
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Jelly and Light Cake.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>5 lemons—juice of all and grated peel of two.</li>
<li>2 large cups of sugar.</li>
<li>1 package of Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in two cups of cold water.</li>
<li>2 glasses pale sherry.</li>
<li>1 pint of boiling water.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Stir sugar, lemon-juice, peel, and soaked gelatine together,
and leave, covered, for an hour. Then pour over
them the boiling water; stir until the gelatine is dissolved;
strain through a flannel bag, without pressing.
Add the wine, and let all drip, untouched, through double
flannel. Pour into a wet mould. In cold weather, or if
set on ice, it will be ready for use in six hours. Pass a
basket of light cake with it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lobster Bisque.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 can of lobster.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>1 quart of cold water.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>½ cup of pounded cracker.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>A little cayenne pepper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Free the lobster from all bits of shell, and cut up small,
tearing as little as may be. Put the water into a saucepan,
with the salt and pepper. When boiling, stir in the
lobster and stew half an hour. Heat the milk in another
vessel, and, when scalding, stir in the cracker and set in
hot water for ten minutes. The lobster having cooked
for thirty minutes, add the butter, and simmer five minutes
longer. Then pour in the milk; mix all up well;
set for five minutes in hot water, and serve in a tureen.
Pass sliced lemon with it.</p>

<p>This <i>bisque</i> is delicious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Chicken.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare a fine young fowl as for roasting, with the exception
of the dressing, which should be left out. Early
in the day (if you have no gravy already made) put on
the feet and giblets to stew in two cups of cold water,
with a little minced onion. When the giblets are very
tender, and the liquid has boiled down to one cupful,
strain it and set aside the giblets to cool. Chop a
quarter of a pound of pork, put it in the bottom of a pot,
lay the chicken upon it; pour the gravy over it; cover
<i>tightly</i> and set where it will heat steadily, but not reach
the boil under an hour. Increase the heat, not allowing
the steam to escape, for an hour longer, but it should not
stew fast at any time. By this time the fowl should be
thoroughly done. Remove carefully to a hot dish; season
the gravy, adding a little hot water if needful, and
strain out the pork. Add the giblets, chopped fine, stew
fast for one minute, pour over the chicken, and it is
ready for the table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Croquettes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of cold boiled rice.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of melted butter.</li>
<li>2 eggs, well beaten.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful sugar.</li>
<li>A little flour.</li>
<li>Salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work butter and sugar to a cream, and these into the
rice. Salt, and stir up with the eggs to a smooth paste.
Make into oval balls or rolls, with well-floured hands.
Roll in flour, and fry, a few at a time, in sweet lard.
Drain well and eat hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Winter Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, take out the seeds, cut into strips, and lay in
cold water, one hour. Cook in boiling water, a little
salt, until very soft. Drain off every drop of water, and
mash with a potato beetle, stirring in a large spoonful of
butter, and seasoning with pepper and salt. Mound up
in a vegetable dish and serve hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Snow.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 fine pippins (raw).</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of powdered sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make a custard by stirring into the hot milk half the
sugar, the yolks of all the eggs, and the white of one,
and cooking, stirring constantly until it thickens. Let
this cool while you whip the whites to a stiff <i>méringue</i>
with the rest of the sugar. Peel the apples, and grate
directly into the <i>méringue</i>, stirring in at once that the
coating of egg may prevent them from changing color.
Put the cold custard in the bottom of a glass dish, and
heap the snow upon it. Eat soon after making it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tea and Macaroons.</span></h3>

<p>Pass after dinner in the dining-room, or send into the
parlor.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ayrshire Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 lbs. of lean beef.</li>
<li>2 lbs. of marrow-bones well cracked.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>3 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>6 large potatoes.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>½ cup of oatmeal.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>6 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the vegetables and herbs; cut the meat fine, and
break up the bones. Put the oatmeal to soak in a pint
of water. Slice the potatoes, and parboil them in hot
water for ten minutes. Add them then to the other
vegetables, and put them all, with the meat and bones,
into a soup-pot, with the water. Stew for four hours,
until the liquor in the pot has fallen one-third. Strain
through a colander, set aside two quarts of the stock
until to-morrow, after seasoning it all, and return the rest
to the fire. Boil up and skim; add the oatmeal, and
stew, covered, forty minutes, stirring often, lest it should
burn.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Chops and Tomato Purée.</span></h3>

<p>Broil the chops, after trimming them neatly; rub, as
soon as they leave the gridiron, with butter on both sides;
pepper and salt, and cover, for a few minutes, in a hot
water dish, that they may take up the seasoning.</p>

<p>Make the <i>purée</i> by stewing a can of tomatoes until
almost dry, then seasoning, and stirring in a tablespoonful
of butter rolled in flour. Simmer three minutes, arrange
the chops on their sides, overlapping each other,
inside of the curve of a flat dish, and pour the <i>purée</i>
within their enclosure.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Strips.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and cut the potatoes in long strips, the length of
the potato, and not more than the sixteenth of an inch
thick. Lay in ice-water for one hour; dry by laying on
one clean towel and pressing another upon it, and fry, not
too many at once, in <i>hot</i> lard, a little salt. Take out so
soon as they are browned lightly, toss in a hot colander,
and serve in a deep dish lined with a napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Soak all night, and in the morning change the cold water
for lukewarm. Leave in this two hours; drain it off and
put them on to boil in cold water, with a piece of fat salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
pork two inches square. Cook slowly until soft. Take
out the pork, drain the beans well, season with pepper,
and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ lb. of macaroni broken into inch lengths.</li>
<li>2 cups of boiling water.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>1 large cup of milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>Grated peel of half a lemon.</li>
<li>A little cinnamon and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the macaroni in the water until it is tender, and
has soaked up the liquid. It must be cooked in a farina-kettle.
Add the butter and salt. Cover for five minutes
without cooking. Put in the rest of the ingredients.
Simmer, after the boil begins, ten minutes longer, before
serving in a deep dish. Be careful, in stirring, not to
break the macaroni. Eat with butter and powdered sugar,
or cream and sugar.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 pints of good stock.</li>
<li>1 quart of cold water.</li>
<li>12 mealy potatoes.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>½ cup of rice.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>Seasoning to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Slice the potatoes, cover with boiling water, and cook
ten minutes. Throw away this water, and add the quart
of cold, slightly salted, and the onion, to the potatoes.
Boil to pieces, and pass, with the water in which they
were boiled, through a colander into the stock. Heat all
together, and cook gently half an hour, before adding the
rice, which should have been boiled soft in a very little
water. When the rice is nearly dry, stir in the butter, put
into the soup, and simmer five minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Beef.</span></h3>

<p>A rib-roast is best for family use. Make your butcher
saw off about half of the bone, after cutting the ends
of the ribs clear of the meat; then fold the flap neatly
around to the thick part, and secure with skewers. The
“trimmings” are yours—a fact housekeepers often fail
to insist upon. The meat is weighed before you buy it.
Take all that you pay for—and you will seldom be at a
loss for a “base” for soup or gravy. Between butchers
and cooks, there is enough wasted in American kitchens
to supply a National Soup-house that might feed all the
poor in the land.</p>

<p>Put your beef in the dripping-pan; pour a cup of boiling
water over it, and roast ten minutes for every pound.
Bake as soon as the juices begin to flow—the oftener in
reason the better. If your meat has much fat on top,
cover it—the fat—with a paste of flour and water. When
nearly done, remove this, dredge the beef with flour, baste
well with gravy, strew salt over the top, and serve. Pour
the fat off from the gravy; return to the fire, thicken
with browned gravy, season, and boil up once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes—Baked.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil, take off the skins, and, half an hour before you
take up your beef, lay the potatoes in the dripping-pan to
brown, basting them with the meat. They should be of a
fine brown. Drain off the grease, and lay about the beef
when dished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Hominy.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cupful of cold boiled hominy (small grained).</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>1 large teaspoonful of butter.</li>
<li>The same of sugar.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work the melted butter well into the hominy, mashing
all lumps. Then come the beaten yolks; next, sugar
and salt; then, gradually, the milk; lastly the whites.
Beat until perfectly smooth, and bake in a greased pudding-dish
until delicately browned. Serve in the bake-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cabbage Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Chop a firm white cabbage with a sharp knife. A dull
one bruises it. Make a dressing of two tablespoonfuls of
oil; six of vinegar; a teaspoonful each of salt and sugar;
half as much each of made mustard and pepper. Work
all in well, the vinegar going in last, and then beat in a
raw egg, whipped light. Pour over the salad, toss up
with a fork, and serve in a glass dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Arrow-root Pudding—(Cold).</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 even tablespoonfuls of arrow-root. Get the Bermuda if you can, or you may require more.</li>
<li>3 cups of fresh milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of crystallized peaches, chopped fine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk to scalding, and stir in the arrow-root
wet up with cold milk. Stir ten minutes, and add sugar
and butter. Stir five minutes more, and pour out. When
nearly cold, beat in the fruit. Pour into a wet mould.
Make on Saturday, and on Sunday, turn out upon a dish,
and eat with sugar and cream. It is very good without
the fruit, but needs more sugar in making.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee</span></h3>

<p>Should be served last of all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bread Soup.</span></h3>

<p>A few raw beef-bones and trimmings, spoken of yesterday. Bones, bits of
skin, gristle, etc., left from Sunday’s roast when you have cut off the
meat for the <i>cannelon</i>.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pint of stock.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>2 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>4 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>1 lb. stale bread-crusts, the drier the better, provided they are not mouldy or sour.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Crack the bones, chop meat and vegetables; put on in
the water, and boil slowly down to two quarts. Strain the
liquor; let it cool; take off all the fat, season, and return
to the pot with the stock. Boil up and skim; put in
the crusts; stew, covered, half an hour. Take it from the
range and <i>beat</i> in the butter, taking out indissoluble bits.
Then simmer, in a vessel set within another of boiling
water, half an hour.</p>

<p>As you will see, by a careful perusal of these directions,
the preparation of this soup requires little actual expenditure
of time. I beg, therefore, that you will “gather up
the fragments” from larder and bread-box, and give your
family a hot, nourishing, “comforting” dish of porridge,
if it <i>is</i> wash-day.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cannelon of Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the meat from your cold roast, and chop it fine.
Season well, and beat into it the yolks of three eggs and
the white of one. Add one-third as much cold mashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
potato as you have meat, wet up with gravy, and make,
with floured hands, into a long roll—three times as long
as it is broad. It should be just soft enough to handle.
Dredge thickly with flour, and lay in a greased baking-pan.
Invert another one over it, and bake until it is
hissing hot on top and sides, when uncover, and brown
quickly. Brush over the outside with white of egg;
dredge again with flour, shut the oven-door to brown this,
glaze again with egg, and shut up the oven for one minute.
Carefully, with the aid of a cake-turner, slip the
<i>cannelon</i> to a hot dish and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chow-chow</span></h3>

<p>Should go around with the <i>cannelon</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Stew.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and cut the potatoes into dice. Stew in hot
water, with a slice of fat salt pork, cut very small, half a
minced onion and a little chopped parsley, until the pork
is dissolved and the potatoes very tender. Pepper, and
if necessary, salt, and pour into a hot, deep dish. The
“stew” should not be too liquid, nor yet stiff.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pork and Beans.</span></h3>

<p>This is a good, nourishing dish for Monday, and easily
managed, if you have boiled the beans on Saturday. Fill
a bake-dish nearly full of them, and put in the middle a
piece of fat salt pork, about three inches wide, which you
have parboiled in your soup. It will improve the taste
of the “stock” and be itself the better for the temporary
association. Pour in a little hot water to keep the beans
from burning. Pepper and bake, covered, for half an
hour. Remove the cover and brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Batter Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of peaches—whole ones, if you have them—and
pour into the bottom of a buttered pudding-dish
before you make your batter. There should be just
syrup enough to half cover the fruit.</p>

<p>For batter, take 1 quart of milk.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>10 tablespoonfuls of <i>prepared</i> flour.</li>
<li>5 eggs, beaten light.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of melted butter.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the yolks light, add the milk and salt, and pour
slowly into a hole made in the middle of the flour.
Finally, stir in the whites lightly, but not until you have
beaten the batter smooth. Pour over the peaches and
bake quickly. You can put it in the oven after the beans
are done, setting the latter aside to keep warm. If you
have not time to make sauce, eat with butter and sugar.
Do not let the pudding stand after drawing from the oven,
or it will fall.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. lean veal.</li>
<li>3 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>2 blades of mace.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>2 quarts of water.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of rice flour (or corn-starch).</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the meat and onion fine, cover with the water,
and stew slowly three hours. Strain, cool and skim.
Season and set back on the fire. Boil up and skim carefully;
add the milk, and when hot, the corn-starch wet
with cold water. As it thickens, take out a cupful, pour
upon the eggs; stir into the soup, and take at once from
the fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Breast of Veal.</span></h3>

<p>Make incisions between the ribs and the meat, and
stuff with a force-meat of dry bread-crumbs, chopped pork
or ham, pepper, sweet marjoram, and one beaten egg.
Save a little to thicken the gravy. Roast slowly, basting
often and copiously. Dredge at the last with flour, and
baste well, when this has colored, with butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Stew a can of tomatoes twenty-five minutes; season
with pepper, salt, a little sugar, and a tablespoonful of
butter. Cook five minutes and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Plain Boiled Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare <i>very</i> thin, and put on (after having lain half an
hour in cold water) in boiling water. Cook fast until a
fork will go easily into the largest; drain off every drop
of water, and throw in salt. Set back, uncovered, on the
side of the range, or where they will dry quickly, yet not
scorch. Serve in an uncovered dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Celery.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, scrape, trim off the green tops, and throw aside
for seasoning soups, vinegar, etc., the rank green stalks.
Lay the better parts in cold water until wanted for the
table. Put into a tall glass or celery-stand.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Essex Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of fine bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of sago, soaked three hours in a little water.</li>
<li>¾ of a cup of powdered suet.</li>
<li>5 eggs, beaten light.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful flour, wet in cold milk.</li>
<li>½ lb. of whole raisins, “plumped” by laying them in <i>boiling</i> water for two minutes.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook the sago in enough water to cover it until tender
and nearly dry. Heat the milk and pour upon the beaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
eggs and sugar, add the crumbs, beating into a good
batter in a bowl; then suet, flour, sago, and salt. Butter
a mould <i>thickly</i> and lay the raisins, dredged with flour, in
the bottom and sides, in whatever designs you fancy.
Fill the mould with the batter—well beaten up at the last—putting
it in by cautious spoonfuls not to dislodge the
raisins, which should be imbedded in the butter. Put on
the lid of the pudding mould, and boil one hour, never
relaxing the heat. Dip in cold water and turn out upon a
flat dish. Eat with jelly sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jelly Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ cup of currant jelly.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter.</li>
<li>1 lemon—juice and half the grated peel.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of nutmeg.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>1 glass of wine.</li>
<li>1 cup of boiling water.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the hot water gradually into the jelly, and add
the butter, lemon, and nutmeg. Warm almost to a boil,
put in the sugar, then the flour wet up with cold water.
Boil up once sharply; add the wine, and take from the
fire. Set, closely covered, in a vessel of hot water until
wanted. Stir well before pouring it out.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Julienne Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>2 lbs. of mutton, and a like quantity of veal, with some beef-bones.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>Half a cabbage.</li>
<li>3 onions.</li>
<li>3 stalks of <i>blanched</i> celery.</li>
<li>½ can of tomatoes.</li>
<li>5 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat small, crack the bones, and put on to
cook in five quarts of water with the herbs. While it
simmers, prepare the vegetables, with the exception of
the cabbage and tomatoes, by cleaning, paring, and cutting
them into narrow strips about two inches long, and as
nearly as possible of uniform size. Lay them in cold
water for one hour. Drain very dry, and put them into a
frying-pan in which you have melted, but not cooked, the
butter, and dissolved the sugar. Toss them over a hot
fire until they are coated with the butter, but do not let
them scorch. Set aside in a clean vessel set within one
of hot water. When the meat has boiled to rags, and
the liquid is reduced one-third, strain it and set by until the
fat rises and can be taken off. Return the soup to the fire,
season, boil up and skim; add the glazed vegetables,
with the chopped cabbage—which should have been parboiled,
then drained—and the tomatoes, cut up small.
Stew gently for one hour. Serve with the vegetables in
it.</p>

<p>This will make enough soup for two days, unless your
family be large.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Halibut Steaks—Broiled.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and wipe the steaks dry. Broil upon a buttered
gridiron, turning when the lower side is done. Remove
carefully to a chafing-dish, and anoint with a mixture of
butter, salt, pepper, and a little lemon-juice.</p>

<p>Always serve fish upon hot plates. Pass potatoes, and
no other vegetable, with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Potatoes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 cups of mashed potatoes.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>Yolks of four hard-boiled eggs. (Cut the whites in rings to garnish your fish.)</li>
<li>Handful of dry bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat butter, milk, and seasoning into the potatoes while
hot. Put a layer in the bottom of a buttered pudding-dish;
cover this with thin slices of yolk; pepper and salt
them; spread another layer of potato over these, and
proceed in this order until the dish is full, having the top
layer of potato. Strew thickly with bread-crumbs. Bake
covered until hot through, then brown quickly. Serve
in the bake-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal and Ham Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the meat from the cold roast of yesterday. Put the
bones, well-cracked, the refuse bits of meat and skin into
a saucepan with an onion, a few spoonfuls of tomatoes,
and three cups of cold water, and cook slowly until there
remains but one cup of gravy. Strain and season, thickening
with a tablespoonful of browned flour. Cut the
veal into small, even slices. If you have no cold boiled
ham, cook half a pound on purpose by boiling in your
gravy stock. Slice this also, and lay upon the veal, with
now and then a slice of hard-boiled egg. Fill the dish
with alternate layers of veal and ham; pour in the gravy,
and cover with a thick crust of good pastry, such as you
made last Thursday for your pork-pie. Bake one hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Cauliflower.</span></h3>

<p>When your soup is about half done, and before you
strain it, take out a cupful, strain through a thin cloth, and
put into a saucepan, with a little salt and a tablespoonful
of butter. Cut a cauliflower into small bunches, when you
have washed and trimmed it, and lay these in the cooled
broth. Stew slowly, covered, twenty-five minutes, turning
the bunches now and then. When they are tender, take
them out, lay in a covered dish to keep warm, stir into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
broth a tablespoonful of butter, cut into bits and rolled in
flour, with nearly half a cup of milk. Pepper, boil up
once, and pour over the cauliflower.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pancakes with Preserves.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pint of prepared flour.</li>
<li><i>About</i> a quart of milk.</li>
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the yolks light, add the salt and two cups of milk,
then the flour and beaten whites alternately, and thin with
more milk until the batter is of the right consistency. It
should be quite thin. Have ready in a small frying-pan a
tablespoonful of butter or sweet lard, hissing hot, but not
discolored by too long heating. Pour in enough batter to
cover the bottom of the pan, and fry quickly, pouring off
the fat so soon as the cakes set. Turn it with a lift of your
spatula and a skilful toss of the pan at the same time.
As fast as the pancakes are done—the same lard will do
for several—let an assistant spread each upon a <i>hot</i> plate
and cover with sweet jam or jelly, rolling up neatly so
soon as this is done. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, and
set in a warm oven until you are ready for dessert.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Broth.</span></h3>

<p>Draw, stuff, and truss a pair of chickens, as for roasting;
tie soft pack-thread around their legs and wings, binding
them close to their bodies, and put on to boil in four
quarts of cold water, a little salted. They will require at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
least one hour’s boiling, if they are of fair size. Do not
cook fast, especially at first. Try with a fork if they are
tender, and if it pierces the breast easily, take them up,
butter well, and set in a warm place, covered. Take out
a cupful of liquor when they are three-quarters done, in
which to cook your rice. Strain the broth after taking out
the fowls, season with pepper and chopped parsley and
put again over the fire. Take off the scum, as it rises, and
boil hard fifteen minutes. Then add a half cupful of rice,
previously stewed soft in a very little water. Simmer a
quarter of an hour; pour in a cup of milk in which has
been stirred a tablespoonful of rice-flour; bring to a slow
boil, and pour a few spoonfuls upon two beaten eggs.
Return these to the soup, stir them in and take from the
fire. Have ready the giblets and one hard-boiled egg
chopped fine in the bottom of the tureen, and turn in the
broth upon them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chickens and Rice.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil a cup of rice in a little water. When it has
taken it up, and is about half done, add the cupful of broth
taken from the soup, seasoned well. Cook the rice slowly
in it until done. (Always cook rice in a farina-kettle, and
shake, instead of stirring.) It should absorb all the gravy.
At the last, stir in a beaten egg, mixed with a tablespoonful
of melted butter. It is best to do this with a fork, and
not a spoon. Make a low, flattened mound of the rice
upon a hot dish; remove the pack-threads from the
chickens and lay them on the top. Pass grated cheese
with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p>To each cupful of mashed potato, add half a raw egg,
beaten light, a little salt and pepper, and half a teaspoonful
of butter. Beat well. Make into oblong balls, or rolls,
flour well and fry, a few at a time, in boiling lard, or dripping.
Drain off the fat and serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Select those of uniform size, wash, wipe, and boil until
a fork will penetrate them easily. Skin, set in the oven a
moment to dry, and send to table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Slaw—Cream Dressing.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 small head of white cabbage, shred fine.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk, scalding hot.</li>
<li>¾ of a cup of vinegar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>1 egg, beaten light.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of sugar.</li>
<li>1 even tablespoonful of corn-starch.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful essence of celery.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub butter and sugar together and pour over them the
hot milk. Beat into these the frothed egg. Put into a
vessel set within another of hot water, add the corn-starch
wet up with cold water, boil slowly until it thickens, and
set aside. In another saucepan scald the vinegar; put in
the pepper and salt with essence of celery, and pour hot
over the cabbage. Mix up well; put back into the saucepan,
and stir briskly over the fire until it is smoking all
through, but not until it boils. Turn it into a bowl, stir
into it the custard with a silver fork, until well mixed;
cover, to keep in the strength of the vinegar, and set it
where it will cool suddenly. It is very fine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Poor Man’s Plum Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>Small loaf of stale bread.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of sugar.</li>
<li>½ lb. seeded raisins, cut in two.</li>
<li>Cinnamon to taste.</li>
<li>A pinch of salt.</li>
<li>Butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Slice the bread and cut off all the crust. Butter thinly
and lay in order in a <i>well</i>-greased pudding-dish, strewing
each layer with raisins. Heat the milk, put in sugar
and salt, and pour over the beaten eggs. Lay a heavy
saucer upon the top of the bread and soak with the
custard. Let all stand half an hour, then set in a dripping-pan
of boiling water, cover closely, and cook one
hour, keeping the pan full of water at a hard boil. Turn
out and eat with liquid sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wednesday’s Soup.</span></h3>

<p>The Julienne soup which, as I stated in the receipt for
making it, was sufficient for two days, will have kept perfectly
well in the refrigerator, or in any cold closet. You
have now only to warm it over—not quite to the boil, and
it will be even better than upon the first day. It is wise,
sometimes, to skip a day with a <i>réchauffé</i>, for fear of
wearying those for whose comfort your bills-of-fare are
made up.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Cod.</span></h3>

<p>Sew up the piece of fish in a thin cloth, fitted neatly to
the shape, and boil in salted water (boiling from the first),
allowing about fifteen minutes per pound. Unwrap carefully
and pour over it a sauce made thus:</p>

<p>Heat half a cup of milk and as much water together;
stir in a tablespoonful of butter, cut into bits and rolled in
flour, and when it has thickened, pour by degrees upon
two beaten eggs. Put back into the saucepan and stir
for one minute; add salt, chopped parsley, and a dozen
capers or nasturtium seeds. Take at once from the fire.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Patés.</span></h3>

<p>Line your paté-pans with a good paste, made according
to either of the receipts already given this month, and
bake in a brisk oven.</p>

<p>Mince the chicken left from yesterday. Put the bones
and stuffing into a saucepan with two cups of cold water,
and stew down to one cup of gravy. Season this well, add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
three tablespoonfuls of milk when you have strained out
the bones, a tablespoonful of butter, and a very little parsley.
The stuffing should thicken it sufficiently. Stir in
the chicken, warm until hot, but do not let it boil, or it
will be spoiled. Fill the paste-shells, having taken them
from the tins; arrange upon a <i>hot</i> dish and set within an
open oven until they are sent to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Fingers.</span></h3>

<p>Cut good pastry, left from your patés, into strips three
inches long and two inches wide. Strew with grated
cheese, season with pepper and salt; double the paste
upon this lengthwise, and bake in a quick oven. Brush
over with beaten egg just before taking them up, and
sift a little powdered cheese upon them.</p>

<p>Pile, log-cabin-wise, upon a folded napkin laid within a
flat dish, and eat without delay, as they are not good cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes and Mashed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>The receipts for these standard dishes having been
already given this month, it is scarcely necessary to repeat
them here. Bear in mind, always, that they must be
served hot, and the turnips be well drained.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potato Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 lb. parboiled sweet potatoes.</li>
<li>½ cup of butter.</li>
<li>¾ cup of white sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of cinnamon.</li>
<li>4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of nutmeg.</li>
<li>1 lemon, juice and grated rind.</li>
<li>1 glass of brandy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let the potatoes get entirely cold, and grate them.
Cream the butter and sugar; add the yolks, spice and
lemon. Beat the potato in by degrees, to a light paste;
then the brandy, lastly the whites. Bake in a buttered
dish, and eat cold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bean and Celery Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of dried beans, soaked all night.</li>
<li>1 bunch of celery—the blanched stalks only.</li>
<li>1 lb. of salt pork, cut into strips.</li>
<li>1 lb. of beef—lean, also cut up.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>Pepper.</li>
<li>5 quarts of water—cold.</li>
<li>1 onion, minced.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cover beans, meat, onions, and half the celery cut into
bits, with the water, and boil to pieces, and until the
liquid is reduced one-third. Rub the beans and celery
through a fine colander into the soup. Return to the fire,
season with pepper, put in the rest of the celery, cut into
inch-lengths, and simmer half an hour, stirring often, that
it may not “catch” on the bottom. Set aside a quart of
it, if you can spare as much, for Monday’s soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jugged Pigeons.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and wash well, and stuff with a dressing made of
the giblets boiled and chopped, a slice of fat pork also
minced fine; the yolks of two hard eggs rubbed to powder,
some bread-crumbs, pepper and salt, bound with a
beaten raw egg. Tie the legs and wings close to their
bodies, and pack the pigeons in a tin pail with a <i>tight</i>
top. Plunge this into a pot of boiling water; put a
weight on top to keep it steady, and cook two hours and
a half. The water should not boil over the top. Drain
off the gravy into a saucepan, thicken with a tablespoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of butter rolled in flour. Season, boil up, pour over
the pigeons. Cover again, and leave in the hot water
ten minutes before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Shred Macaroni.</span></h3>

<p>Break half a pound of pipe macaroni into pieces two
inches long, and cook in boiling water, a little salted, ten
minutes. Drain off the water, and spread the macaroni
out to cool upon a dish. When cold, take a sharp knife
or a pair of scissors, and split each piece in half, lengthwise.
Put on in a farina-kettle with a cup of hot milk
and a tablespoonful of butter, seasoning with pepper and
salt. Cover and stew tender, but not to breaking. Ten
minutes after the boil should do this. Then stir in three
tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. Serve in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brussels-Sprouts.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and pick over very carefully. Put on in plenty
of boiling water with a little salt, and cook fifteen minutes
after the water begins to boil anew. Drain well and pile
upon a dish, with drawn butter poured over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sponge-Cake Fritters.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>8 penny sponge-cakes—very stale.</li>
<li>1 cup of boiling milk, with a pinch of soda stirred in.</li>
<li>4 eggs whipped light.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of flour wet up in cold milk.</li>
<li>¼ lb. currants, washed and dried.</li>
</ul>

<p>Roll the cakes into fine crumbs; pour over them the
hot milk, with the soda and flour stirred into it. Cover
for fifteen minutes, then beat until cold. Add the
whipped eggs—the yolks first, then the whites; finally,
the currants dredged with flour. Beat all well. Drop in
great spoonfuls in boiling lard, trying one first to be sure
that the batter is of the right consistency; drain quickly
in a hot colander; sprinkle with powdered sugar mixed
with nutmeg, and serve hot.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mushroom Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of knuckle of veal, well cracked.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>Bunch of parsley.</li>
<li>A slice of ham, or some ham or salt-pork bones.</li>
<li>1 can of French mushrooms.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of flour.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>4 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Crack the bones and mince the meat, onion, and parsley.
Cover with the water, and boil gently three hours,
or until the stock has diminished one-half. Strain, season,
boil up and skim. Add the mushrooms, drained from the
can liquor, and sliced. Stew twenty minutes; put in the
milk, the flour, wet up in cold water, and when it thickens,
beat a cupful into the whipped eggs. Stir into this the
butter, return to the soup, let it almost boil, and pour out.</p>

<p>To the lovers of mushrooms this is a delicious soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Ducks.</span></h3>

<p>Draw, clean and wash a pair of ducks. Stuff <i>one</i> only
with a dressing made of bread-crumbs, the hard-boiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
yolk of an egg, a little minced sage and onion. Rub the
inside of the other with melted butter, pepper and salt.
Many do not like the taste of onion and sage, while others
do not enjoy roast duck without the flavor of these condiments.
Put the fowls into the dripping-pan, pour a cup
of boiling water over them, and roast about an hour,
basting frequently. At the last, dredge with flour, and
baste with butter; then brown. Chop the giblets fine,
pour the fat from the top of the gravy in the dripping-pan,
thicken with browned flour that which is left, and
stir in the giblets.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas</span></h3>

<p>Have, from time immemorial, been the adjunct of roast
ducks. As the best substitute to be had at this season,
open a can of preserved green peas—the French cans
are best; let them stand an hour to get rid of the airless
taste that is apt to cling to canned vegetables; pour off
the liquor; cook twenty minutes in boiling water, a little
salt; drain dry, and stir up in them a teaspoonful of butter,
with pepper to your liking.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Savory Scotch Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>1 cup of best oatmeal, soaked all night in cold water.</li>
<li>1 cup of gravy.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>When your soup is ready to strain, dip out a cupful and
set by to cool. Take off the fat and stir into the soaked
oatmeal. Mix up well; put in a farina-kettle with boiling
water around it, and add by degrees, as it thickens,
the milk heated to scalding. When all is in, salt and
pepper to taste and cook fast, stirring often, ten minutes.
Take from the fire, and let it cool.</p>

<p>N.B. If you have the gravy, all this can be done on
Saturday.</p>

<p>When cold, beat in the butter, melted, working out all
the lumps and taking the skin from the top. Beat in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
whipped eggs, working up fast and hard. Pour into a
buttered pudding-dish; bake, covered, one hour, then
brown. Serve in the bake-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach in a Mould.</span></h3>

<p>Pick over carefully, clip off the stems and put on the
leaves in boiling water, with salt stirred in. Boil hard
fifteen minutes. When done, drain, pressing out all the
water. Chop fine; put back into the saucepan with a
piece of butter—a large spoonful for a good dish—a little
powdered sugar, salt and pepper to taste. Stir and toss
until very hot; press hard into a mould wet with hot
water, and turn out with care upon a heated dish. Lay
round slices of hard-boiled eggs on the top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Turret Cream.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>1 package Coxe’s gelatine.</li>
<li>1 heaping cup of white sugar.</li>
<li>3 eggs beaten light, whites and yolks separately.</li>
<li>½ lb. crystallized fruit.</li>
<li>Vanilla flavoring.</li>
<li>Juice of a lemon in which half the grated peel has been soaked, then strained out.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the gelatine three hours in a large cup of cold
water. Scald the milk, stir in the sugar, and when this
has melted, the gelatine. Stir over the fire five minutes;
pour out half of the mixture into a bowl, and add the
whipped yolks to that left in the saucepan. Stir one
minute, and take from the fire. Flavor the yellow gelatine
with lemon—the white with vanilla. As soon as the yellow
begins to congeal, whip one-half of the stiffened whites
into it, a little at a time, with a Dover egg-beater. Add
the rest to the white gelatine, in the same manner, whipping
each in until it stiffens before adding more, and not
ceasing until both are heaps of “sponge.” Wet the inside
of a tall fluted mould with water, and arrange in the
bottom, close to the outside of the mould, a row of crystallized
cherries. Then, put in a layer of the white mixture;
on this, close to the outside, strips of apricots or
peaches; then a layer of yellow mixture, another border<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of cherries, and so on, until the materials are used up.
Do this on Saturday. Next day, dip for one instant in
hot water, and invert upon a flat dish.</p>

<p>Eat with brandied fruit. It will be a beautiful dessert.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee.</span></h3>

<p>Pass with light cakes or sweet biscuits.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato and Bean Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of tomatoes; take out the hard and unripe
portions, cut up the rest in small pieces, and heat to a boil
before adding the bean soup set aside from Saturday.
Simmer all together half an hour, season to taste, and
pour over the dice of fried bread you have put in the
bottom of the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ham and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Pour a little hot water in a frying-pan, if you use
smoked raw ham for this dish, and cook the slices in it ten
minutes. Let them get perfectly cold. Fry in their own
fat until tender throughout and crisp at the edges. Drain
the fat from them and arrange them upon a hot dish.
Strain the fat, return to the pan, and fry the eggs without
turning. Cut the ham in neat slices, lay an egg upon
each, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricassee of Duck.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the meat from the bones of yesterday’s ducks, dividing
the joints neatly, and slicing the breast, etc.
Crack the skeleton to pieces, and put it, with the skin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
stuffing, and gristly bits, into a saucepan. Cover with
cold water, and stew until a cupful of good gravy is extracted.
Strain and season this; put in the sliced duck.
Set within a pot of hot water and bring the contents of
the inner saucepan <i>almost to</i> a boil. Add a couple of
beaten eggs; stir up well and set aside in the hot water,
covered, for five minutes. The meat must not actually
boil once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Corn.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of corn, an hour before cooking it. Put it
into a saucepan when you are ready for it; cover with
boiling water, and let it stand without cooking, for ten
minutes. Drain off the water; cover the corn with hot
milk, a little salted; set within a vessel of hot water, and
cook for half an hour, or until tender. Stir in a tablespoonful
of butter, cut into thirds, each rolled in flour;
simmer ten minutes, pepper, and turn into a deep covered
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Glazed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil them in their skins; peel quickly and lay in
the dripping-pan within a hot oven. As soon as they
begin to “crust” over, baste with good dripping or butter.
Repeat this three times until they are of a glossy brown.
Eat hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Queen’s Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>10 fine pippins, pared and cored.</li>
<li>½ lb. macaroons, pounded fine.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful cinnamon.</li>
<li>½ cup crab-apple or quince jelly.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of brandy.</li>
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful corn-starch.</li>
<li>Whites of 3 eggs.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the apples into a buttered pudding-dish. Fill this
half full of cold water; cover <i>closely</i> and bake until a
straw will pierce them. Let them stand, covered, until
cold. (Do this on Saturday.) Drain off the water the
day you mean to use them. Put a spoonful of jelly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a few drops of brandy into each apple. Strew with cinnamon
and sugar. Cover and let them stand while you
scald the milk, and stir in the macaroons, the salt and
the corn-starch wet up in cold milk. Boil for one minute.
Take from the fire, beat up well, and let it cool
before whipping in the frothed whites. Pour this mixture
over the apples and bake half an hour in a brisk oven.
Eat warm with a sauce made of the water in which the
apples were stewed, well sweetened and spiced, a tablespoonful
of butter, rolled in flour and the beaten yolk of
an egg. Heat the liquor, sweeten and season; thicken
with butter and flour; boil up; pour gradually over the
egg, and set in hot water until it is needed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">German Sago Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. knuckle of veal, well cracked.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>2 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>Some pork bones, if you have them.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs, minced.</li>
<li>4 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>¾ of a cup of German sago, soaked two hours in cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the meat, celery, herbs, and onion, and crack the
bones. Cover with the water, and cook slowly three
hours, or until the meat is boiled to shreds. Strain, season,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
boil up and skim well, put in the soaked sago and cook
slowly half an hour. The sago should be entirely dissolved.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak and Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Broil your steak as usual. Fry in a little butter one
onion, sliced, until brown. Strain it out, and when your
steak is done, and laid upon a hot dish, pour the butter in
which the onion was fried over it. Add pepper and salt,
and the faintest suspicion of made mustard, turn over it

<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. of lean beef, cut into dice.</li>
<li>3 stalks of <i>blanched</i> celery.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>Handful of chopped cabbage.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>1 carrot.</li>
<li>2 roots of salsify, cut small.</li>
<li>Chopped parsley.</li>
<li>½ cup of rice, previously boiled for fifteen minutes.</li>
<li>½ can of tomatoes, cut up.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 quart cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prepare beef and vegetables early in the day; mix all
up well, and put into a strong earthenware jar, with a good
cover of the same material. Coat this top thickly with a
stiff paste of flour and water to exclude the air, and set in
the oven for six hours. Once in a while, grease the paste
to prevent it from scorching or cracking. It is also well
to set the jar in a dripping or bake pan of boiling water.
Serve without straining.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Devilled Lobster.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 can of preserved lobster.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>3 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of made mustard.</li>
<li>A good pinch of cayenne pepper.</li>
<li>Boiled eggs for garnishing.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Open the lobster-can and empty it into a bowl an
hour before using it. Mince evenly. Put vinegar, butter
and seasoning into a saucepan, and when it simmers,
add the lobster. Cook slowly, covered, half an
hour, stirring occasionally. Turn into a deep dish, and
garnish with slices of egg. Eat hot with buttered Boston
crackers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Liver à la Mode.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 fine, fresh liver.</li>
<li>½ lb. salt pork, cut into lardoons.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls good dripping.</li>
<li>2 sliced onions, small ones.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful Harvey’s Sauce.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful mixed spices.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful sweet herbs, chopped.</li>
<li>Pepper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash the liver, and soak half an hour in cold, salted
water. Wipe dry and lard with the fat pork, allowing it
to project on both sides. Heat dripping, onion, herbs,
and spice in a frying-pan. Put in the liver and fry both
sides to a light brown. Turn all into a saucepan, add the
vinegar, and water enough to cover it; put on a close lid
and stew gently one hour and a half. Lay the liver on a
hot dish, add the sauce to the gravy, strain it, thicken with
browned flour, boil up; pour half over the liver, and send
the rest up in a sauce-boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Celery.</span></h3>

<p>Cut two bunches of celery, the best stalks only, into
inch-lengths, and stew in boiling water, a little salt, for ten
minutes. Drain off the water, and add a cup of milk,
a tablespoonful of butter, rolled thickly in flour, a little
pepper and salt. Simmer three minutes after heating,
and pour into a shallow bowl to cool. Butter a bake-dish,
strew the bottom with fine bread-crumbs. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
celery is almost or quite cold, beat into it two eggs, and
pour into the dish. Strew bread-crumbs thickly over the
top, turn a tin plate over all, and bake twenty minutes.
Remove the cover and brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes au Gratin, with Vermicelli.</span></h3>

<p>Mash the potatoes as usual, with butter, milk, and salt.
Smooth into a hillock upon a pie-plate, and strew with a
handful of vermicelli broken small, cooked soft in boiling
water, a little salt, then drained perfectly dry and spread
out to cool. Brown all in a quick oven, glaze with butter,
slip to a hot dish, and it is ready.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 butter crackers, soaked in water, and beaten smooth.</li>
<li>Juice of three lemons and half the grated peel.</li>
<li>1 cup of molasses.</li>
<li>A pinch of salt.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of melted butter.</li>
<li>Pie-paste for shells.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the pulp of the lemons, leaving out the thick
white peel, <i>very</i> fine; stir into the crushed crackers, with
the butter and salt. Beat the molasses into this, gradually,
with the grated peel. Line two pie-dishes with good
paste, fill with the mixture and bake, without upper crusts.
Eat warm, or cold. They are best fresh.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Soup with Barley.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of beef from the shin.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>2 lbs. of bones.</li>
<li>1 onion stuck with cloves.</li>
<li>2 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>The half can of tomatoes left from yesterday’s soup.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>Nearly a cup of pearl barley.</li>
<li>4 quarts of water.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut up the meat and crack the bones. Cut up celery,
turnips, and tomatoes. Put all these, with the onion, into
the soup-pot, with the gallon of cold water, and boil gently
three hours. The liquor should be reduced one-third.
Wash the barley and boil fifteen minutes in a very little
water. Strain the soup, pressing hard. Season; let it
boil up once, and skim before adding the barley and the
water in which it has boiled. Simmer half an hour, and
serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Loin of Veal.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare a dressing of bread-crumbs, a little chopped
<i>corned</i> ham, parsley, pepper and salt, moistened with
milk. Have the bones taken out of the meat, and fill the
holes thus left with the stuffing. Secure the meat into a
good shape with skewers, and cover the top and sides with
thick foolscap paper, binding it with strings. Grease
paper and strings, put the veal into your dripping-pan
with a cup of hot water, and bake, basting the paper now
and then with dripping, to prevent scorching. At the
end of an hour, take out the meat and remove the paper.
Pour off the gravy, carefully setting it by; return the
meat to the oven with a cupful of <i>milk</i> in the pan instead
of the gravy. Baste with butter, lavishly, once,—afterwards,
and often with the milk as it heats. Roast, not too fast,
nearly an hour more, or until your meat is tender. Should
the milk evaporate too rapidly, add a little hot water.
Indeed, this is a wise precaution against scorching. Take
up the veal, thicken the gravy left in the oven, with a
tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour, salt, and pepper,
heat carefully that the milk may not “catch,” and pour
some over the meat, serving the rest in a boat. Veal
cooked in this way is very nice, but requires much attention
at the last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Strew the bottom of a pie-dish with fine crumbs, having
greased it first. Drain off much of the liquor from a can
of tomatoes, add it to the soup, pour the tomatoes upon
the crumbs, season with pepper, salt, and butter; strew
more crumbs thickly over the top. Bake, covered, twenty
minutes; then brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kidney Beans with Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Soak the beans overnight. The next day boil them
until soft in salted water. Drain this off. Strain the first
gravy taken from the roast veal—before the milk is substituted—into
a saucepan; add a tablespoonful of butter,
and half a small onion, minced. Boil five minutes, strain
through a soup-sieve, pressing the onion hard; season
with pepper, salt, and a little chopped parsley; pour over
the beans, simmer fifteen minutes, closely covered, drain
off half of the liquor, and serve in a covered dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Plain Boiled Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 cups—full ones—of good flour.</li>
<li>2 cups of “loppered” milk or buttermilk; sour cream is best of all.</li>
<li>1 <i>full</i> teaspoonful of soda dissolved in hot water.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
<li>½ cup finely-powdered suet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir the milk and soda gradually into the flour, working
it smooth. Put suet and salt in, and beat all thoroughly.
Boil in a buttered mould an hour and a half.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hard Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>½ glass of wine.</li>
<li>Juice of a lemon and half of the grated peel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Warm the butter, and rub into the sugar, working into
a light cream. Add lemon and wine. Mould as you like,
and set aside to cool.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Drain the liquor from the oysters through a colander.
Put the liquor over the fire with half as much water, salt,
pepper, and a large tablespoonful of butter for each quart
of soup. Let it boil up well, and put in the oysters.
Heat slowly, and as soon as they “ruffle,” which should
be about five minutes after they reach the boil, strain off
the soup. Have in another vessel as much boiling milk as
there was oyster liquor. Pour the oysters into a hot
tureen, put a large spoonful of butter upon them; when
it melts entirely, turn in the milk. Stir in well, add the
hot soup, cover, and serve with sliced lemon and crackers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brown Fricassee of Chicken.</span></h3>

<p>Joint the chicken neatly, and lay in salted cold water
half an hour. Cut a quarter of a pound of salt pork into
strips, and fry in good dripping. Strain it out, skin the
chicken as far as possible, and fry in the same fat, with a
sliced onion. Chop the pork fine and put into a saucepan;
next, the onion; at last, the fowl. Sprinkle a teaspoonful
of mixed allspice and cloves over all, pour on
cold water to cover them well, put on a tight lid, and
stew gently for an hour or more, until the meat is tender.
Arrange the fowl upon a hot dish; strain the gravy; season
to taste with pepper, salt, and parsley; thicken with
browned flour; boil up once; pour over the chicken;
cover, and let all stand for five minutes before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ladies’ Cabbage.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a firm cabbage in two waters. Drain, then set
aside to get cold. Chop fine; add two beaten eggs, a
tablespoonful of butter, pepper, salt, and three tablespoonfuls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of milk. Stir all well, and bake brown in a
buttered pudding-dish. Eat very hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes au Naturel.</span></h3>

<p>Choose those of uniform size; put on in their skins, in
boiling water. When about half done, check the boil suddenly
by a cupful of cold water. This is said to make old
potatoes mealy. Boil again until a fork will pierce them.
Drain off the water; sprinkle with salt to make the skins
crack, and dry out in the uncovered pot, on the range, for
a few minutes before peeling.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sliced Apple Pie.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 lb. of prepared flour.</li>
<li>¾ lb. of butter.</li>
<li>Ice-water to make stiff dough.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop half of the butter into the flour. Work up with
ice-water. Roll out thin; baste all over with butter, and
sprinkle lightly with flour; fold closely into a long roll;
flatten, and re-roll as thin as at first; then baste again.
Repeat this three times. Set the last roll in a cold place
for at least an hour. Roll out, and line two buttered
pie-plates, reserving enough for upper crusts.</p>

<p>Pare, core and slice juicy pippins; put a layer within
the crust; sprinkle sugar liberally over it, strew half a
dozen whole cloves upon this; then more apples, etc.,
until the dish is full. Cover with crust and bake.</p>

<p>Eat barely warm, with sugar and cream.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Plain Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>5 lbs. shin of beef.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>2 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>5 quarts of water.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup.</li>
<li>½ cup coarse corn-meal.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 cup of boiling milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Slice the meat and crack the bones. Cut the vegetables
into strips and fry the onions in good dripping.
Then put all, with meat and bones, into a soup-pot with
the water. Cover and cook gently five hours. Strain
the liquor from the shreds of meat and rub the vegetables
through the colander. Season and set aside half the
stock for to-morrow. Put that meant for to-day into a
soup-kettle; season and boil up for a minute, that you
may skim it; then add the corn-meal, previously scalded
with a cup of boiling milk. Stir in well, and simmer half an
hour before adding the catsup and pouring into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breaded Mutton Chops.</span></h3>

<p>Trim the chops from fat and skin, leaving a bit of bone
clean at the end of each. Beat up a raw egg; dip the
chops in this—having peppered and salted them; roll in
cracker-dust, and fry brown in good dripping or sweet
lard. Drain, and arrange in rows upon a hot dish, the
large end of each overlapping the small end of the next.
Garnish with parsley.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Milanaise Potatoes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>12 boiled potatoes.</li>
<li>¾ cupful of gravy left from yesterday’s fricassee.</li>
<li>Juice of half a lemon.</li>
<li>Yolks of 2 raw eggs.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of dry grated cheese.</li>
<li>½ cup stale bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat and strain your gravy. Put into a saucepan with
the seasoning, butter, and lemon, bring to a boil, and
stir it into the beaten egg. Slice the potatoes; lay a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
row within the outer round of a neat pie-plate. (I
hope you have one with a silver stand for the table.)
Pour a few teaspoonfuls of sauce upon these; lay another
and smaller row inside of the first; more sauce, and
so on, until you have a low cone of sliced potato; pour
sauce over all, coat with the bread-crumbs and cheese,
mixed together; pepper and salt, and bake twenty minutes
in a quick oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of green peas; turn off the liquor and
cover with boiling water, a little salt. Boil fast until
tender; drain well; stir in a tablespoonful of butter;
pepper and salt, and serve in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoanut Sponge Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of stale sponge-cake crumbs.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>1 cup of grated cocoanut.</li>
<li>Yolks of two eggs and whites of four.</li>
<li>1 cup of white sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful rose-water.</li>
<li>A little nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scald the milk and beat into this the cake-crumbs.
When nearly cold add the eggs, sugar, rose-water, and
lastly the cocoanut. Bake three-quarters of an hour in
a buttered pudding-dish. Should it brown too fast, cover
with white paper. Eat cold, with white sugar sifted over it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tapioca Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the stock reserved for to-day. Bring
the soup to a boil and stir in half a teacupful of “grained”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
tapioca, which has been soaked three hours in a little cold
water. Add also seasoning, if needed; simmer half an
hour and pour out. Send around grated cheese with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Beef and Potato Balls.</span></h3>

<p>When your beef is about three-quarters done, pour
nearly all of the gravy from the dripping-pan. Have
ready some mashed potato worked smooth with a beaten
egg, pepper and salt, then made into balls and rolled in
flour. Place them in the pan around the meat and baste
until well browned. Serve in the same dish with the
beef.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sliced Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in their skins until a fork will go easily into them.
Pare and slice with a sharp knife lengthwise; fry lightly
and quickly in good dripping, or butter; drain off the
grease, and serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower au Gratin.</span></h3>

<p>Wash the cauliflower, cut off green leaves and stalks,
and divide into neat bunches. Boil in hot water, salted,
until tender. Drain well; dip each piece in melted
butter, and strew thickly with fine, dry crumbs, mixed
with pepper and salt. Arrange flower end uppermost, in
a pudding-dish, and brown the crumbs upon the upper
grating of an oven. Serve in a vegetable dish, and pass
a boat of drawn butter with them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Southern Rice Pudding—Méringued.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 qt. of fresh milk.</li>
<li>1 cup of raw rice.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>4 eggs beaten light.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful grated lemon-peel.</li>
<li>A pinch of cinnamon, and the same of mace.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the rice two hours in the milk. Simmer in a
farina-kettle until tender. Rub butter and sugar to a
cream. Beat up the eggs, and whip the mixture into
them while the rice is cooling. Stir all together; flavor,
and bake three-quarters of an hour in a buttered dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>.
If baked too long, the custard will break. So soon as it
is well set in the middle of the dish, draw to the oven-door,
and spread with a <i>méringue</i> made of the whites of
three eggs whisked stiff with one tablespoonful of powdered
sugar and juice of half a lemon. Close the oven-door,
and brown delicately. Eat cold. Make it on
Saturday.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hasty Soup.</span></h3>

<p>The trimmings of your roast beef, and any other cold
meat you may have—about two and a half pounds in all,
chopped very fine.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of browned flour.</li>
<li>2 quarts of water.</li>
<li>2 handfuls of fried bread.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of walnut catsup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put meat, butter, salt and pepper into a saucepan;
add two quarts of cold water, and bring slowly to a boil.
Cook half an hour after the boil fairly begins. Strain
hard through a thin cloth; thicken with browned flour;
add the catsup; boil up once, and pour over the fried
bread in the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Trim yesterday’s roast on top, bottom, and sides, saving
all the fragments for your soup. Then make incisions
quite through the meat, and thrust in numerous lardoons
of fat salt pork, projecting above and below. Rub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the meat all over with vinegar, and then with melted
butter, rubbing both in well. Put in a dripping-pan.
Take the fat from the top of yesterday’s gravy; thin it
with a little hot water; strain this into the dripping-pan,
and baste the meat plentifully with it, keeping another
pan inverted over it between times. If your oven be
moderately good, the beef should be ready for table in
forty-five minutes. Pour a few spoonfuls of gravy over it
when dished. Put the rest into a sauce-boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Parsnips.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape, slice lengthwise, and lay in cold water half
an hour. Cook tender in boiling water, a little salt.
Drain off half the water, and stir in a tablespoonful of
butter rolled thickly in flour. Pepper and salt to your
taste, and stew gently five minutes before pouring into a
deep, covered dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Browned Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash soft with butter, milk, and salt. Heap as irregularly
as possible upon a pie-dish, and set in a quick oven.
Mem.: The dish should be well greased. As the potato
browns, glaze it with butter. Slip carefully to a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">“Brown Betty.”</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>2 cups chopped tart apples.</li>
<li>½ cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of cinnamon.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put a layer of chopped apple in a buttered pudding-dish;
strew with sugar, butter, and cinnamon. Cover
with bread-crumbs; then more apple. When your dish
is full, cover with crumbs. Invert a tin plate over it, and
“steam” forty-five minutes in a good oven. Then, uncover
and brown. Eat warm, with sugar and butter, or
cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tea and Albert Biscuit.</span></h3>

<p>Pass these after the pudding. Tea-drinking is restful
as well as refreshing on a busy day. Weary housekeepers
can have no more innocent nervine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">White Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Knuckle of veal—weight 5 or 6 pounds.</li>
<li>¼ lb. lean ham—raw or cooked.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>4 blades of mace.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>½ cup raw rice.</li>
<li>5 qts. of cold water.</li>
<li>¼ lb. almonds, blanched and pounded.</li>
</ul>

<p>Crack the veal-bones, and cut off the meat in small
pieces. Put into the soup-pot with the chopped ham;
the onion sliced, the herbs and spice. Pour on the
water, and boil very slowly five hours. The water should
be reduced to three quarts. Strain off the liquor. Season
three pints, and pour back upon the bones, etc.
Cover tightly in a stone crock, and put away for to-morrow’s
stock. To the remainder add the rice and the
pint of water in which it has been soaking for two hours.
Season, and cook gently, taking care it does not burn,
while you blanch the almonds by scalding off their skins,
and pound them in a Wedgewood mortar. When the
rice is soft, put in these, and cook slowly ten minutes.
Scald the milk, pour it upon the beaten eggs by degrees,
add to the soup; stir one minute, but not to the boil, and
pour into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Shoulder of Mutton with Oysters.</span></h3>

<p>Take the main bones out of a shoulder of mutton; fill
the cavity with oysters, and bind the meat firmly over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
incision. Sew the shoulder into a neat shape in a piece
of stout tarlatan; put on in boiling water, slightly salted,
allowing eighteen minutes to each pound in cooking.
When done, unbind carefully upon the dish in which you
are to serve it. Pour over it a sauce made of equal
parts of oyster liquor and the broth from the boiling meat,
seasoned, then thickened with a generous lump of butter,
cut into bits, and rolled in flour, and some chopped parsley.
Boil up once well, and put half upon the meat,
the rest in a sauce-boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Creamed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash in the usual way, whipping very light with a fork,
adding a cupful of rich milk and two tablespoonfuls of
softened butter, beating in gradually. Return to the
saucepan; stir constantly for three minutes; turn into a
bowl and whip with an egg-beater, hard, one minute.
Pile in a hot deep dish, and set in the open oven until
you are ready to send it to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Soak overnight. Next day, put on in cold water—salted—and
cook soft. Drain dry, turn into a greased
bake-dish, stir in a great spoonful of butter, and when
this has melted, enough milk to fill the dish one quarter
full. Season with pepper and salt; cover and bake forty
minutes. Remove the top, and brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cottage Puffs.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of rich milk—half cream if you can get it.</li>
<li>4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
<li>1 good tablespoonful of butter, chopped into the flour.</li>
<li>A pinch of salt.</li>
<li>Enough prepared flour for thick batter. Try two cups, and add, by degrees, as you need more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix the beaten yolks with the milk; then the salt and
whites; at last, the flour. Bake in greased iron pans,
such as are used for “gems” and corn-bread. The oven
should be quick. Turn out and eat with sweet sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Giblet Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and cut the giblets of your fowls into three pieces
each. Stew tender in a pint of water. Take the cake
of fat from the broth set by yesterday. Put a half cupful
aside for your macaroni sauce. Warm the rest and strain
out the bones, etc. Return to the fire, boil up and skim,
chop the giblets fine and put them in with the water in
which they were boiled. Simmer a quarter of an hour;
stir in half a cupful of fine, dry bread-crumbs. Season,
if necessary; boil ten minutes longer, stirring often, and
pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Smothered Chickens.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare the chickens as for broiling, splitting each
down the back. Lay flat in a dripping-pan, pour a cupful
of boiling water upon them; set in the oven and invert
another pan over them, so as to cover them <i>tightly</i>.
Roast half an hour, lift the cover and baste freely with
butter. In ten minutes more, baste with gravy from the
dripping-pan. In five more, with melted butter—abundantly—going
all over the fowls. Keeping the chickens
covered except while basting them, increase the heat,
until you ascertain, by testing with a fork, that they are
done. They should be coffee-colored all over, rather
than brown. Dish, salt and pepper them; cover while
you thicken the gravy with browned flour, adding a little
hot water, pepper, salt, and chopped parsley. Boil up;
put a few spoonfuls over the chickens—the rest in a
gravy tureen.</p>

<p>They are extremely nice, if faithfully basted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni with Tomato Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Break half a pound of macaroni into inch lengths.
Cover with salted boiling water, and cook twenty minutes,
or until tender. Have ready a sauce prepared as follows:
open a can of tomatoes; take out half the contents and
cut up very small. Add, with pepper and salt, and a
little minced onion, to the half cup of broth reserved for
this purpose, and stew together twenty minutes. Put the
macaroni into a deep dish, stir well into it a large tablespoonful
of butter. Add to the sauce two great spoonfuls
grated cheese; boil once and strain over the macaroni,
loosening the latter with a fork that the sauce may
penetrate. Serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Chips.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and slice, round, some fine potatoes. Lay in
cold water for one hour. Dry by laying them upon a dry
towel and pressing with another. Fry in salted lard,
quickly, to a delicate brown. Take out as soon as they
are done; shake briskly in a hot colander to free them
from fat, and send to table in a deep dish—uncovered—lined
with a napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Cake.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>3 even cups of prepared flour.</li>
<li>½ cup of corn-starch, wet up with a little milk.</li>
<li>½ cup of butter, rubbed to a cream with the sugar.</li>
<li>½ cup of sweet milk.</li>
<li>The whites of 6 eggs whipped stiff.</li>
</ul>

<p>Add the milk to the creamed butter and sugar; then
the corn-starch, lastly the flour and whites alternately.
Bake in greased jelly-cake tins.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Filling.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 tart pippins, grated.</li>
<li>1 beaten egg.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>Juice and grated peel of one lemon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat sugar, egg, and lemon together. Grate the apples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
into this mixture. Put into a farina-kettle and stir until
it boils. Cool before putting between the cakes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee</span></h3>

<p>May to-day be passed with the cake.</p>

Fig Custard Pudding.<br />
——<br />
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Broth.</span></h3>

<p>Cut an old fowl into quarters. Lay in salt and water
an hour; put on in a soup-kettle with an onion, and four
quarts of water. Bring <i>very</i> slowly to a gentle boil, and
keep this up until the liquid has diminished one-third, and
the meat shrinks from the bones. Take out the chicken,
salt it, and set aside with a cupful of the broth, in a bowl
(covered), until to-morrow. Season the rest of the broth
and put back over the fire. Boil up and skim, and add
nearly a teacupful of rice, previously soaked for two
hours in a cup of water. Cook slowly until the rice is
tender. Stir a cup of hot milk into two beaten eggs, and
then into the soup. Let all come to the boil—barely—when
you have added a handful of finely-minced parsley,
pour out into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rolled Beefsteak.</span></h3>

<p>Beat a large sirloin steak flat with the broad side of a
hatchet. Fry a sliced onion in a little butter. Take it
out with a skimmer, and put the meat into the pan. Fry
quickly on both sides, soaking up all the butter and
leaving a brown glaze upon the steak. Spread it upon a
dish. Chop the onion, mix with bread-crumbs, minced
herbs and a few chopped mushrooms, and lay this force-meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
upon the steak. Roll the meat up tightly upon the
dressing. Fasten with soft packthread and skewers.
Put into a saucepan with a cupful of cold water. Set
where it will heat very slowly, keeping on a close lid.
Simmer thus two hours, turning now and then. Transfer
the meat to a hot dish. Strain the gravy, add a little hot
water, if needed; thicken with browned flour; stir in
some minced mushrooms, a tablespoonful of catsup and
another of butter. Boil about three minutes, pour over
the steak, when you have removed the threads. The
skewers are to be withdrawn by the carver.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salsify Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape, wash, and grate the roots into a mixture made
of a beaten egg, one cup of milk, and enough flour for a
very thin batter. Thicken with the grated salsify; salt
and pepper, and drop, in large spoonfuls, into boiling lard
or dripping. Drain in a hot colander. Eat while fresh.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Drain off the liquor from a can of tomatoes; salt it,
and put aside for another day’s soup. Strew the bottom
of a bake-dish with fine crumbs; cover with tomatoes,
sliced thin. Scatter over these a little minced onion and
some bits of butter, with pepper, salt, and sugar. Proceed
thus until the tomatoes are used up. Cover thickly
with crumbs, fit a plate or tin lid over the scallop, and
bake half an hour. Brown quickly upon the upper grating
of the oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fig Custard Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 lb. best Naples figs.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>Yolks of five eggs and whites of two.</li>
<li>½ package of gelatine soaked in half cup of water.</li>
<li>1 cup sweet fruit jelly, slightly warmed.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>Flavor to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the figs in warm water until quite soft. Split them;
dip each piece in jelly, and line a buttered mould with
them. Heat the milk, stir into the beaten eggs and sugar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
return to the farina-kettle, and cook until it thickens well.
Set by to cool. Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff
froth. Melt the soaked gelatine by adding two tablespoonfuls
of boiling water, and setting it within a vessel
of hot water. Stir until melted, and let it cool. When
it begins to congeal, whip with the Dover egg-beater,
gradually, into the whisked whites, until all is white and
thick. Beat into the cold custard rapidly and thoroughly,
and fill the fig-lined mould. Set on ice, or in a cold
place, until firm. Dip the mould in hot water to loosen
the pudding when you are ready for it. It is delicious.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Split Pea Soup, without Meat.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pint of split peas.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>2 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>1 carrot.</li>
<li>1 turnip.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of butter, cut into bits and rolled in flour.</li>
<li>Tomato juice, saved from yesterday.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and fried bread.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the peas all night. In the morning, put them on,
with the vegetables and herbs cut small, and the tomato
juice; cover with the water, and cook slowly three hours,
or until you can rub all to a pulp through a colander.
Season; simmer fifteen minutes, stir in the butter, cook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
five minutes longer, and pour upon the fried bread in the
tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Halibut.</span></h3>

<p>Lay a cut of halibut, weighing five pounds, in salt and
water for two hours. Wipe dry, and score on top. Bake
an hour, basting often with butter and water melted together.
Test with a fork to see if it be done, and transfer
to a hot dish. Strain the gravy from the dripping-pan
to a saucepan. Stir in a tablespoonful of walnut catsup,
the juice of a lemon, and a tablespoonful of butter, cut
up in three tablespoonfuls of browned flour. Boil, and
pour into a sauce-boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken and Ham Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>The meat from yesterday’s chickens, minced fine.</li>
<li>Half as much cooked ham, also minced.</li>
<li>½ lb. pipe macaroni, broken into inch lengths.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>1 cup of gravy.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Add a little hot water to the chicken broth reserved
yesterday; strain, heat, and cook the macaroni tender in
it. Drain the latter; mix well with the ham and chicken,
beaten eggs, butter, and seasoning. Pour into a greased
pudding-mould with a tight top, and boil for two hours.
Dip the mould into cold water for half a minute; invert
a hot dish, and strike gently upon top and upon sides
to turn it out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and boil until a fork will pierce the largest. Drain
off the water, leaving the potatoes in the pot. Set back
on the range, strew with salt, and dry for three minutes.
Whip up with a stout, four-tined fork until they are a mass
of meal. Add, then, a great spoonful of butter, a cup of
milk, salt, if necessary, whipping all in lightly. Form into
a smoothed mound in a vegetable-dish. Pass with the fish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mixed Pickles</span></h3>

<p>Should go around with both fish and meat, to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cottage Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of sweet milk.</li>
<li>3 cups of prepared flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream the butter and sugar. Beat in the yolks, then
the milk, salt, and the beaten whites alternately with the
flour. Bake in a buttered mould until a straw will come
out clean from the middle; turn out upon a plate. Eat
hot with wine sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wine Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ cup of butter.</li>
<li>2½ cups of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>2 glasses of pale sherry.</li>
<li>½ cup of boiling water.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream butter and sugar, whipping up, by degrees, with
the hot water. Beat five minutes before adding, gradually,
the wine and sugar. Heat in a tin vessel set in boiling
water, stirring often, but <i>not</i> to a boil. Leave in warm
water until you are ready for it. Stir up from the bottom
as you serve.</p>

Willie’s Favorite Pudding.<br />
——<br />
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bone Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 or seven lbs. of uncooked bones, beef, mutton, veal, and salt pork, bought in market for a trifle, and pounded to pieces.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>2 minced carrots.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>2 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper.</li>
<li>½ cup tapioca, soaked two hours in one cup of cold water.</li>
<li>5 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put on the bones and vegetables early in the day. <i>Purchase
soup meat a day beforehand, whenever you can.</i>
Cover with half the water. When the scum arises after
the boil is reached, remove it, and pour in another quart
of cold water. This will bring up more scum. Skim,
after boiling again, and pour in the rest of the water.
When no more scum comes up, cover the pot, and cook
<i>gently</i> four hours, if you can give it so much time. Divide
the liquor into two parts. Set away half in a stone jar,
with the bones in the bottom, fit on the lid, having salted
the liquor. This is Sunday’s “stock.” Strain the rest
through a fine soup-sieve, without pressing the residuum in
the bottom, season it, and having skimmed it carefully after
the boil, stir in the soaked tapioca. Simmer twenty minutes,
and it is ready.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pigeon Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and cut the pigeons into quarters. Wipe
dry and fry lightly in butter or dripping. Sprinkle well
with salt and pepper. Have ready a greased pudding-dish
and a good paste, made according to the receipt given on
Friday of last week. Lay some pieces of pigeon in the
bottom of the dish, and cover with a mixture of chopped
eggs, and the giblets, boiled tender in a little water, then
minced. More pigeons, and another layer of the force-meat.
Stir two tablespoonfuls of butter, rolled in flour,
into the hot water in which the giblets were boiled; season,
and pour enough into the pie to half cover the birds.
Cover with a thick crust with a slit in the middle, and bake
an hour if the pie be of fair size. Glaze with beaten egg,
just before you take it from the oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil them, and lay in a moderate oven until soft to
the touch. Wipe, and serve with the skins on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Hominy.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cupful cold boiled hominy (the small grained).</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>1 large spoonful melted butter.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the butter into the hominy until there are no lumps
left. Work up very thoroughly. Scald the milk; pour
upon the beaten yolks and sugar, add the salt, and beat,
by degrees, into the hominy. At the last, whip in the
frothed whites, and pour into a buttered bake-dish. Put
at once into the oven and bake until lightly browned.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Willie’s Favorite Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 loaf stale baker’s bread.</li>
<li>½ cup of powdered suet.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of citron, chopped fine.</li>
<li>½ lb. sweet almonds, blanched and cut in thin strips.</li>
<li>5 pippins, also chopped.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>1 cup of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>A little salt, stirred into the milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the bread into thick slices, and pare off the crust.
Cover the bottom of a greased mould (with plain sides)
with these, fitted in nicely. Soak with milk, spread with
the suet and fruit mixed together. Sprinkle this with sugar,
and strew almond shavings over it. Fit on another stratum
of bread, soaking it likewise with milk, more of the suet and
fruit mixture, sugar and almonds, and so on to the topmost
layer which must be bread, and <i>very</i> moist with milk.
Cover the mould, set in a dripping-pan, which you must
keep full of boiling water, and cook in the oven one hour
and a half. Pass a knife carefully between the pudding
and the sides of the mould; turn it out; sift white sugar
thickly over it and eat with sweet sauce. You may have
enough left from yesterday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>¼ lb. macaroni, broken into short pieces.</li>
<li>The stock set aside yesterday.</li>
<li>A heaping tablespoonful of corn-starch, wet up with cold water.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>1 onion sliced.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the onion five minutes in a pint of salted water.
Strain it out, and when the water again boils, put in the
macaroni with the butter. Boil very gently until quite
tender. Drain off the water, and spread the macaroni out
to cool somewhat. Meanwhile, take the fat from the top
of your cold soup; thin the latter with a cup of boiling
water, and strain into the soup pot. Heat to a boil, skim,
season, stir in the corn-starch, and when this has thickened
it, put in the macaroni. Simmer ten minutes, and it can
be put into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>The breast, fore leg, and saddle are best for this purpose.
A nice way of cooking the breast is to sew it up in stout
tarlatan and boil it <i>eight</i> minutes for each pound. Then
take it out (saving the liquor), wipe as clean as possible,
and put it into a dripping-pan; score the skin with a sharp
knife, rub in pepper and salt; wash with beaten egg, strew
thickly with bread-crumbs, and bake half an hour in a
good oven. Baste twice with melted butter. Make a
gravy of a cupful of the broth, thickened with a tablespoonful
of butter, rolled in flour. When it has boiled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
stir into it a little chopped parsley; a teaspoonful of
minced onion, and three times as much chopped pickled
cucumber, with the pounded yolks of two hard-boiled eggs.
Stew three minutes; pour part of it over the mutton; the
rest into a gravy-boat.</p>

<p>N. B.—Test your mutton with a skewer before taking it
from the oven. If not done, leave it in a while longer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Rissoles.</span></h3>

<p>Work into cold mashed potato, a beaten egg, a little butter,
pepper and salt. Make into egg-shaped balls; roll
in beaten egg, then in pounded cracker, and fry in hot
lard, or dripping, to a light brown. Drain <i>well</i> in a colander,
and serve in a hot napkin-lined dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce Salad.</span></h3>

<p>One-third as much oil as you have vinegar; pepper and
salt at discretion. Cut up the young lettuces with a
sharp knife; pile in a salad-bowl; sprinkle with powdered
sugar, and pour the rest of the ingredients mixed
together over the salad. Toss up with a silver fork, to
mix all well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach à la Reine.</span></h3>

<p>Boil the spinach in salted water twenty minutes. Drain
very thoroughly. Chop fine; return to the saucepan
with a teaspoonful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of butter,
three tablespoonfuls of cream, a little nutmeg, pepper and
salt. Stir constantly until almost dry. Have ready an
egg-cup dipped in boiling water. Fill it with spinach,
press hard and turn out upon a hot dish. Do this until
all is moulded. Put a slice of egg upon the top of each.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Transparent Puddings.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ lb. butter.</li>
<li>1 lb. of sugar.</li>
<li>6 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
<li>Juice of 1 lemon and grated rind of two.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of nutmeg.</li>
<li>½ glass of brandy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream butter and sugar, beat in all the yolks and the
whites of three eggs, the lemon, spice and brandy. Bake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
in open shells of good paste. (Add another “baste” of
butter to the crust made for your pigeon pie; roll out and
line paté-pans with it.) When nearly done, spread each
with a <i>méringue</i> made of the reserved whites, whipped
up with a little powdered sugar. Color very lightly.</p>

<p>As they are to be eaten cold make them on Saturday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee,</span></h3>

<p>Hot and strong, should be handed at the close of dinner
particularly if you attend afternoon service!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Savory Porridge.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the meat from yesterday’s roast, and take the least
desirable portions, with any remains of other meat you
may have—veal, pork, or poultry. Chop extremely fine;
and rub them through a coarse sieve or colander. Skim
the fat from the liquor in which your mutton was boiled;
add a chopped onion, a bunch of sweet herbs and a stalk
of celery, chopped. Boil down to three pints; strain,
season, and when it boils up again, skim and stir in your
chopped meat, with half a cupful of dry bread-crumbs.
Cook, covered, twenty minutes; put in a tablespoonful
of butter, rolled in flour, and a little minced parsley.
Stew five minutes before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Minced Mutton and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Mince the cold mutton. Have ready warmed a cupful
of gravy, left from yesterday, or made from the bones of
the roast. Season the meat well and stir into this, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
do not cook it as yet. Strew the bottom of a buttered
bake-dish thickly with dry crumbs; pour the mince upon
it; cover with crumbs, and set in the oven, covered,
until bubbling hot. Then break enough eggs over the
top to cover the mince well; stick bits of butter here and
there, pepper and salt, and bake quickly until well “set.”
Serve in the bake-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes au Maître d’Hôtel.</span></h3>

<p>Slice cold boiled potatoes a quarter of an inch thick,
and put into a saucepan with four or five tablespoonfuls
of milk, two or three of butter, pepper, salt, and chopped
parsley. Heat quickly, stirring all the time until ready to
boil, when stir in a tablespoonful of flour, and two minutes
later, the juice of a lemon. Take instantly from the
fire so soon as this last ingredient goes in.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String-Beans—Sauté.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of string-beans and drain off the water.
Cut them into inch lengths; cook twenty minutes in
salted boiling water. Drain them, put them back into
the saucepan with two tablespoonfuls of butter, a pinch
of salt and a little pepper. Toss them over a clear fire
for three minutes, until they are very hot; then turn out
into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jaune Mange.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in a cup of cold water.</li>
<li>2 cups of boiling water.</li>
<li>Yolks of 4 eggs, beaten light.</li>
<li>1 orange—juice and one-half the grated rind.</li>
<li>Juice of one lemon and one-third of the grated peel.</li>
<li>1 cup sherry wine.</li>
<li>1 cup of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>A good pinch of cinnamon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put gelatine (soaked), sugar, juice, peels, and spice into
a bowl and pour the boiling water over them. Stir until
dissolved; put over the fire in a saucepan, and heat
almost to boiling. Pour, very gradually, upon the beaten
yolks. Return to the fire—in a farina-kettle—and stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
<i>one minute</i>. It must not boil. Take it off, add the wine,
and strain through double tarlatan.</p>

<p>If you have ice, or if the weather be cold, set the
mould containing this in the refrigerator, or in a very cool
closet from Saturday to Monday. By making it on the
former day, you can add to the excellence of your <i>méringue</i>
on the transparent puddings by using the whites of
the four eggs required for the receipt. Pass light cakes
with the jaune mange.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quick Lobster Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Three lbs. of fish—the less choice parts of halibut or
cod will do—those which are too bony for table use.
Cover with three quarts of cold water and boil down to
less than two or until the fish is in rags. Strain through
a fine sieve and put on to boil. Season with salt and
pepper. When you have skimmed it well, stir in a cup
of milk in which has been mixed two tablespoonfuls of
corn-starch. Boil up well; then add two tablespoonfuls
of butter. Stir it in, take out a cupful of soup and beat
it into two eggs. Return to the soup and leaving the
saucepan on the range, but not over the fire, stir in a can
of preserved lobster, freed from bones and cut up small.
Cover and stand in a pot of hot water ten minutes before
pouring out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Tenderloin of Beef.</span></h3>

<p>As I have before stated, this is the best, and not the
least economical cut for the table, there being no waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and scarcely any bone. Put in the dripping-pan, pour a
cup of <i>boiling</i> water over it, and roast carefully, basting
often with its own gravy. When nearly done, dredge
with flour and baste once with butter. Do not let it once
get dry while cooking. Allow about ten minutes per
pound if you like it rare and juicy—that is, if your oven
be of moderate heat. Pour the fat from the gravy, thicken
what is left with browned flour, pepper, and salt, boil up,
and put into a gravy-boat. Pass made mustard with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Please see receipt given last Friday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Succotash.</span></h3>

<p>Open the can an hour before it is to be cooked, and
turn into a bowl. Drain off the liquor, put the succotash
into a saucepan, cover with boiling water, and stew half
an hour. Throw off half the water, and add as much cold
milk. When it boils, put in a tablespoonful of butter,
cut into quarters and rolled in flour; pepper and salt;
simmer five minutes and serve in a vegetable-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Trifle.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 heaping cupfuls of good apple sauce, well sweetened and flavored with grated lemon peel.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk, and pour over the beaten yolks and
sugar. Put back in a farina-kettle, and stir until it begins
to thicken, say about eight minutes. Set by in a shallow
vessel to cool. Beat the whites very stiff, then whip gradually
into the apple. When all is in, and well beaten, pile
up in a glass dish, and pour the cold custard about the
base.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lady’s-Fingers,</span></h3>

<p>Or small, fresh sponge-cakes, should be passed with the
trifle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mock-Turtle Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 calf’s head, well-cleaned, with the skin on.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>5 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>5 tablespoonfuls of browned flour.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of allspice.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of mace.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of pepper.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls, at least, of salt.</li>
<li>2 raw eggs.</li>
<li>A little flour.</li>
<li>2 glasses of brown sherry.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful mushroom, or walnut catsup.</li>
<li>5 quarts of water, cold, of course.</li>
<li>1 sliced lemon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the calf’s head an hour in cold water, and boil in the
five quarts of water until the bones will slip easily from
the flesh. Take out the head, leaving the bones and
broth in the pot. Take out the tongue and brains, and
put them in separate plates. Set aside, also, the cheeks
and the fleshy parts of the scalp to cool. Chop the rest,
including the ears, very fine. Reserve four spoonfuls of
this for force-meat balls. Season the rest with pepper,
salt, onion, allspice, herbs, and mace, and put back into
the pot. Cover closely, and cook four hours. Should
the liquor sink to less than four quarts, replenish with
boiling water. Just before straining the soup, take out
half a cupful; put into a frying-pan; heat, and stir in the
browned flour, wet up in cold water, also the butter.
Simmer these together ten minutes, stirring almost constantly.
Strain the soup; scald the pot and return the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
broth to the fire. <i>Have ready</i> the tongue and fleshy parts
of the head cut, after cooling, into small squares; also,
about fifteen balls made of the chopped meat, highly
seasoned, worked into the proper consistency with a little
flour and bound with the raw eggs, beaten into the paste.
They should be as soft as can be handled. Grease a pie-plate,
flour the balls and set in a quick oven until a crust
forms upon them, then cool. Now, thicken the strained
broth with the mixture in the frying-pan, stirred in well.
Should there not be enough to make it almost like custard,
add more flour. Then drop in the dice of tongue
and fat meat. Cook slowly five minutes. Put the force-meat
balls and thin slices of a peeled lemon into the
tureen. Pour the soup upon them, add catsup and wine;
cover five minutes and serve.</p>

<p>This king of soups having, of right, received such a long
and minute notice, I shall not repeat the receipt in full
in this work, but take the liberty of referring you, from
time to time, to that just given.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Cutlets and Brains.</span></h3>

<p>Flatten the cutlets with the broad side of a hatchet;
dip in beaten egg, then in cracker-dust, and fry rather
slowly in ham-dripping, if you have it; if not, in salted
lard. Drain off the fat; put into a hot-water dish, pepper,
and cover while you fry, in the same fat, after straining it,
the brains from the head of which your soup was made.
They should first have been boiled for ten minutes,
drained, and cooled; then beaten to a paste with egg,
seasoned with pepper and salt, and dropped by the spoonful
into the scalding fat. Drain, and lay about the cutlets
as a garnish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes au Gratin.</span></h3>

<p>Mash as usual; put into a shallow pie-plate well
greased; strew thickly with dry crumbs, and brown upon
the upper grating of the oven. Glaze with butter, when
the <i>gratin</i> begins to brown well. Slip dexterously to a
flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes and Onion.</span></h3>

<p>To one can of tomatoes add a small onion, minced
fine. Season with pepper, salt, a <i>little</i> sugar, and stew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
twenty-five minutes. Stir in a tablespoonful of butter;
cook two minutes, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce.</span></h3>

<p>Treat as directed on last Sunday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Steamed Bread Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>2 cups fine bread-crumbs.<br />
½ lb. suet, powdered.<br />
½ lb. Sultana raisins, picked, washed, dried, and dredged with flour.<br />
3 eggs.<br />
1 even tablespoonful of corn-starch.<br />
1 tablespoonful of sugar.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk; pour over the eggs and sugar, beaten
together. Stir in the corn-starch; cook one minute, and
pour upon the bread-crumbs, beating all to a batter.
Put a layer of this in the bottom of a buttered pudding-mould.
Cover this with suet; then with raisins; sprinkle
with sugar; then more butter, and proceed in the foregoing
order until the mould is nearly full. Fit on the top,
put into the steamer over a pot of boiling water, and
steam at least two hours. If you have no steamer, boil
one hour and a half. When done, dip the mould into cold
water for half a minute, and turn out, with care, upon a
hot, flat dish. Eat hot with wine sauce.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Curry Soup.</span></h3>

<p>You can, if you dislike the taste of curry, warm up
what was left from your mock-turtle soup, just as it is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
But you can vary it, agreeably to most palates, by stirring
into it, when melted, and almost on the boil, a tablespoonful
of curry powder, if there be more than three pints of
soup—half as much, should there be but a quart. Wet
the powder up in cold water, add to the soup, and cook
three minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Beef.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of beef—not <i>too</i> lean—coarse steak or brisket.</li>
<li>1 chopped onion.</li>
<li>Bunch of thyme, sweet marjoram, and summer savory.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, parsley.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of allspice.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of browned flour.</li>
<li>1 pint of cold water.</li>
<li>½ glass of wine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat into strips about an inch long. Cover
with a pint of water, and stew <i>gently</i> two hours. The
meat should be ready to fall to pieces. Add the onion
and herbs cut up fine, the spice, salt and pepper, and
stew half an hour, closely covered. Then stir in the
browned flour, and when it has thickened, the sauce and
wine. Cover the bottom of a deep dish with strips of
fried bread, and pour the stew over it. If cooked long
and slowly enough, it will be a rich brown mixture, with
no hard lumps of meat in it. Save half a cupful of gravy
for to-morrow.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bermuda Potatoes—au Naturel.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and boil in hot salted water, until a fork will
easily pierce them. Drain off the water, throw salt over
them, and “dry off” upon the range for a few minutes.
Peel, and serve whole.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Macaroni.</span></h3>

<p>Break half a pound of macaroni into short pieces;
cook in boiling water, salted, twenty minutes. Drain,
put a layer into a greased bake-dish; strew thickly with
grated cheese, and stick bits of butter over it. Go on in
this order until the dish is full, strewing cheese and butter
on top. Pour in a cup of milk; bake, covered, thirty
minutes; then brown nicely. Serve in the pudding-dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">White Puffs.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of rich milk.</li>
<li>Whites of 4 eggs whipped stiff.</li>
<li>2 cups prepared flour.</li>
<li>1 scant cup of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>Grated peel of half a lemon.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whisk eggs, lemon, and sugar to a <i>méringue</i>, and add
alternately with the flour to the milk. The salt should be
sifted with the flour. Beat very light, and bake in small,
well-buttered tins, or cups. Turn out, sift powdered
sugar over them, and eat with custard sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Custard Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 large cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 scant cup of scalding milk.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of arrowroot, wet with cold milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the butter into the sugar, add the eggs, and beat
light. Put in corn-starch and spice; finally, pour upon
this mixture, by degrees, the boiling milk. Set within a
saucepan of boiling water five minutes, stirring all the
while, but do not let it really boil.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clam Chowder.</span></h3>

<p>Fry five or six slices of fat salt pork crisp, and chop
fine. Sprinkle a layer in the bottom of a pot; cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
with clams; sprinkle with pepper, salt, and bits of butter,
then with minced onion. Next, have a stratum of small
crackers, split and soaked in warm milk. When the pot
has been filled in this order, cover all with cold water,
and cook slowly (after the water is heated) three-quarters
of an hour. Strain the chowder, without pressing or
shaking; put clams, etc., into a covered tureen; return
the liquor to the pot. Thicken with rolled crackers; add
a glass of wine, a tablespoonful of catsup; boil up, and
pour over the chowder. Pass sliced lemon with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Weak Fish.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and dry the fish. Lay in a broad pan or
dish; salt, and dredge with flour. Fry in hot lard or very
nice dripping to a light brown. In serving, lay the fish
side by side, the head of each to the tail of the one next
him. Garnish with parsley.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Braised Duck.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and wash the duck. Stuff with a dressing of
bread-crumbs seasoned with pepper and salt, a little
onion and sage. Sew up the vent, and tie the neck to
keep in the flavor. Fry the duck in a great spoonful of
butter until lightly browned, turning it often. Add the
butter used for frying to the gravy saved from yesterday;
thin with boiling water, and, having put the duck into a
saucepan, strain this gravy over it. It should half cover
the fowl. Stew slowly forty-five minutes, or until tender,
keeping the lid on all the while. Take up the duck,
cover to keep it warm, strain the gravy, and if very oily,
take off the top. Boil sharply ten minutes in an open
saucepan; thicken with browned flour; put back the
duck into it, and set the saucepan, again covered, in boiling
water for a quarter of an hour. Serve the gravy in a
boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Purée of Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of peas, drain off the liquor, and cook
twenty minutes in boiling water slightly salted. Strain
off the water through a colander; mash the peas with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
back of a wooden spoon, and rub through the colander
into a bowl below. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter into
a saucepan, with pepper, salt, and a little sugar, and, if
you fancy it, three mint leaves finely chopped. Heat,
but not to boiling, stir in the pulped peas, and toss about
with a silver fork or spoon until they are a smoking mass.
Pile in a hot dish, with triangles of fried bread laid up
around the base.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower à la Crème.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a fine cauliflower, tied up snugly in coarse tarlatan,
in hot water, a little salt. Drain and lay in a deep
dish, flower uppermost. Heat a cup of milk; thicken
with two tablespoonfuls of butter, cut into bits, and rolled
in flour. Add pepper, salt, the beaten white of an egg,
and boil up one minute, stirring well. Take from the
fire, squeeze the juice of a lemon through a hair sieve
into the sauce, and pour half into a boat, the rest over the
cauliflower.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Meal Pudding without Eggs.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups Indian meal.</li>
<li>1 cup of flour.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of molasses.</li>
<li>3 cups of sour milk—“loppered,” or “bonny-clabber,” if you can get it.</li>
<li>1 great spoonful of melted butter.</li>
<li>1 <i>full</i> teaspoonful of soda.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of cinnamon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sift the salt with the flour, and mix up well with the
meal. Make a hole in the middle, and pour in the milk,
stirring the meal and flour down into it. Beat smooth.
Mix molasses, spice, butter, and the soda—this last dissolved
in hot water—all together, and beat into the batter—well
and <i>hard</i>. Butter a tin mould with a cover;
pour in the pudding, and boil steadily an hour and a half.
Eat hot with butter and sugar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Broth.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and truss, but do not stuff, a full-grown
fowl. Set aside the giblets for another use. Bind the
legs and wings of the fowl closely to its sides. Put into
a pot with four quarts of water (cold), and cook gently
until the liquor has fallen one-third. Then add a full cup
of rice, soaked for one hour in a very little water, and boil
half an hour more, or until the chicken is tender and the
rice soft, but not broken to pieces. Take out the
chicken. Wipe off the adhering grains of rice, wash over
with butter, salt and pepper, and set, covered, upon a pot
of boiling water to keep hot. Season the soup with pepper
and salt, and simmer ten minutes more. Then strain
out the rice, and cover <i>it</i> to keep hot. Return the soup
to the pot, stir in a cup of hot milk, a tablespoonful of
corn-starch wet with cold water, and a handful of very
finely minced parsley. Boil up, take from the fire, and
pour by degrees upon two beaten eggs. Cover for three
minutes; then pour into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Paté of Salt Cod.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of cold salt cod, soaked all night in soft water, boiled in the morning, left to cool, then “picked” into boneless flakes.</li>
<li>1 cup of oyster-liquor.</li>
<li>2 even tablespoonfuls of rice flour, or corn starch.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>Chopped parsley and pepper.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>3 hard-boiled eggs, minced.</li>
<li>Some rich paste. (See “French Puff Paste,” page 352, <span class="smcap">No. 1, Common Sense Series—General Receipts</span>.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the oyster-liquor, stir in the corn-starch wet up
with cold milk. When it thickens, add the butter and
pepper; next the parsley and fish. Heat almost to boiling,
and stir in the chopped egg. Take from the fire,
and cover, over a pot of boiling water, ten minutes.</p>

<p>Make the shell by lining a profusely buttered cake-mould,
or round pan with nearly straight sides, with a
thick sheet of puff-paste, pricking it at the bottom to prevent
too much puffing. Cut a round piece exactly the
size of the top, for a cover, and bake separately. Bake
both in a quick oven. Let them get almost cool, turn
out the shell with the utmost care; fill slowly with the
prepared fish, that the sides may not give way; fit on the
top; hold an inverted hot plate firmly upon it and reverse
the paté skilfully, leaving the closed side uppermost.
It is easily done, if one is only fearless yet dexterous.
Eat hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Chicken and Rice.</span></h3>

<p>Boil the giblets tender in a little salted water; chop
fine, and when the rice is strained from the soup, mix
them well through it. Pile the rice, when you are ready
to serve it, upon a meat dish; lay the chicken upon the
top; pour a few spoonfuls of egg sauce over it, and send
to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Egg Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>One cup of the broth in which the chicken was boiled,
heated; thickened with a tablespoonful of butter rolled
thickly in flour; poured over two beaten eggs; boiled
one minute, with a tablespoonful of parsley stirred in;
then seasoned and poured upon the pounded yolks of
two boiled eggs placed in the bottom of a bowl. Stir up
well, and it is ready.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in salted water, until tender; mash and drain in
a hot colander, working in butter, salt, and pepper.
Mound up in a hot, deep dish, covered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ambrosia.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>8 fine oranges, peeled and sliced.</li>
<li>½ grated cocoanut.</li>
<li>½ cup of powdered sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Arrange slices of orange in a glass dish; scatter grated
cocoanut thickly over them; sprinkle this lightly with
sugar, and cover with another layer of orange. Fill the
dish in this order, having a double quantity of cocoanut
and sugar at top. Serve soon after it is prepared.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Café au Lait and Sponge-Cake.</span></h3>

<p>To one pint <i>strong</i> made coffee, add the same quantity
of boiling milk. The coffee should be first strained
through muslin into the table-urn, then the milk poured
in with it. Wrap the urn in a woollen cloth, if you have
no “cozy,” for five minutes before serving. Send around
sponge-cake, home-made or bought, with it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Good Stock Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>5 lbs. brisket of beef.</li>
<li>2 lbs. mutton-bones.</li>
<li>2 onions, sliced and fried.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>4 stalks of celery.</li>
<li>Bones of chicken or duck, if you have them.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>6 cloves.</li>
<li>½ cup of sago or barley.</li>
<li>6 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>Sweet herbs.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Slice the meat, crack the bones, chop the vegetables,
and put all on over the fire with the water. Boil slowly
five or six hours; strain; pick out the meat as well as
you can, and set aside. Then, rub the vegetables
through a colander, prior to straining all through your
soup-sieve. Set aside half the stock for Monday. Do
this much on Saturday. Or, if you choose, do not strain
the soup at all until Sunday morning. It will be the
richer for cooling with meat, etc., in it. In either case,
season before setting it away, or it may sour. Put Sunday’s
stock back into the pot; boil up and skim, before
adding the half cup of pearl sago, previously soaked for
two hours in a very little cold water. Simmer twenty
minutes and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef à la Mode de Rome.</span></h3>

<p>Cut a quarter of a pound of streaked salt pork, and the
same quantity of lean beef into strips, and fry, with a sliced
onion, in good dripping. Put them in the bottom of a pot
and lay a rib roast of beef, rolled round, upon them. Add
a pint of boiling water, cover, and cook ten minutes to
the pound, turning the beef three times meanwhile.
Transfer the meat to a dripping-pan, dredge the top with
flour, then baste with its own gravy, once. Keep hot,
without cooking, while you strain the gravy left in the pot,
thicken it with browned flour (always <i>after</i> taking the fat
from the top), season with pepper, and stir in a teaspoonful
of sugar, a handful of Sultana raisins, picked and
washed, and the same quantity of blanched almonds, cut
into tiny strips. Boil gently three minutes, dish the beef,
and pour the sauce over it.</p>

<p>Odd as this receipt may seem to an American housewife,
the result is extremely palatable, and a good change
of fare at this season.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Puff.</span></h3>

<p>Mash the potatoes soft with milk and butter, season and
beat very light with two raw eggs. Smooth and bake to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
a light brown in a greased pudding-dish, in which, also,
serve it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hominy Croquettes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of fine-grained hominy, boiled and cold.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter.</li>
<li>Salt to taste.</li>
<li>¾ cup of finely chopped beef, left over from your soup, after straining the latter.</li>
<li>Pepper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work hominy, butter, and salt to a smooth paste; beat
in the eggs, finally the chopped meat, after peppering and
salting it. Stir up in a farina-kettle until hot, and pour
out to cool. When cold, make into long rolls with floured
hands, flour each well by rolling upon a dish, and fry to a
yellow-brown in sweet lard. Drain off the fat and pile
upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in hot, salted water, twenty minutes, drain and
press hard; chop fine, and return to the saucepan with a
large spoonful of butter, pepper, salt, a little sugar and a
pinch of mace. Stir, and beat until very hot; then pour
into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Snow Custard.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ package of Coxe’s gelatine.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>2 cups of sugar.</li>
<li>Juice of one lemon.</li>
<li>1 large cup boiling water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the gelatine one hour in a teacupful of cold water,
then stir in two-thirds of the sugar, the lemon-juice and
the <i>boiling</i> water. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff
froth, and when the strained gelatine is quite cold, whip
it into the whites, a spoonful at a time for half an hour, if
you use the Dover egg-beater (at least one hour with any
other). When all is white and stiff, pour into a wet mould,
and set in a cold place. Make this on Saturday, and on
Sunday dip the mould into hot water, and turn out into a
glass dish. Make a custard of the milk, eggs, and the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
of the sugar, flavoring with vanilla; boil until it begins to
thicken. When the <i>méringue</i> is turned into the dish, pour
this custard, cold, about the base.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nuts and Raisins</span></h3>

<p>Serve as another and a last course.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Vermicelli Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a quarter of a pound of vermicelli in a little salted
water fifteen minutes. Heat the stock set aside for to-day,
when you have taken the fat from the top, and when
scalding, add the vermicelli.</p>

<p>N. B.—Always break vermicelli and macaroni small
before cooking. Add a little chopped parsley; simmer
fifteen minutes and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Browned Mince of Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Cut all the meat from the bones of yesterday’s roast,
setting away the bones for another day’s soup. Mince the
beef fine; mix with it one-fourth as much mashed potato,
season highly with pepper, salt, a little mustard and catsup;
work soft with the remains of yesterday’s gravy;
heat in a saucepan, then heap upon a stone china dish,
cover the mound with fine crumbs, and brown upon the
upper grating of your oven. Put bits of butter thickly
over the top as it begins to brown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Potatoes—Creamed.</span></h3>

<p>Chop cold boiled potatoes <i>coarse</i>; put on in a saucepan
with a cup of milk, and heat in an outer vessel of hot
water. When scalding, pepper and salt; stir in a tablespoonful
of butter, cut up and rolled in flour, and when
this has melted, a beaten egg, stirred in while the potatoes
are not boiling. Simmer one minute, and turn out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broccoli.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, and let stand in salt and water one hour. Cook
in boiling salted water fifteen minutes. When tender,
drain dry, and serve with melted butter (peppered) poured

<h3><span class="smcap">Barley Broth.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. knuckle of veal. Beef bones from yesterday.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>1 turnip.</li>
<li>1 stalk of celery.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>Chopped parsley.</li>
<li>1 cup Scotch barley.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Break the bones to splinters and chop the meat. Mince
the vegetables, and put all into a soup-kettle, with the
water. Boil slowly three hours, until the liquor has fallen
one-third. Meanwhile wash the barley and boil half an
hour in a little salted water. Strain your soup; cool to
let the fat arise, and take this off. Season with pepper
and salt and boil up. Skim, put in the barley, and cook
gently half an hour longer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Leg of Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>The mutton will be cleaner and in better shape if boiled
tied up in coarse net or tarlatan. Put on in boiling
water, plenty of it, slightly salt, and cook steadily fifteen
minutes to the pound. Save the broth for soup. Undo
the net from the meat, rub the latter over with butter,
lay on a hot dish, and send the oyster sauce in a boat.
Garnish the mutton with sliced cucumber pickles.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pint of oysters.</li>
<li>Half a lemon.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter, rolled well in flour.</li>
<li>1 teacupful of milk.</li>
<li>Cayenne and nutmeg to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the oyster liquor, and when it boils, skim, and put
in the oysters. So soon as they boil, stir in the butter,
cut up and well floured, the spice and lemon-juice. Boil
five minutes, take from the fire and put with the milk
which has been heated in another vessel. Stir up well,
and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kidney Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Soak all night. In the morning put on in warm—not
hot—water slightly salted, and cook tender. Drain dry,
stir in a great lump of butter, a little salt and pepper, and
turn into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bermuda Potatoes—Baked.</span></h3>

<p>Select those of uniform size; wash, and bake in a
moderate oven until soft to the pinching fingers. Wipe
clean, and serve in their skins, wrapped in a napkin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoanut Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 heaping cup fine bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>1 cocoanut, pared and grated.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful corn-starch, wet in cold water.</li>

<li>1 cup of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>Nutmeg and rose-water to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk. Rub butter and sugar to
a cream, and whip in the beaten yolks. Beat this into
the soaked crumbs; stir in the corn-starch, then the
whisked whites—finally, the grated cocoanut. Beat very
hard, pour into a neat pudding-dish, well buttered, and
bake in a moderate oven forty-five minutes. Eat cold,
with powdered sugar on top.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of tomatoes, and cut them up small. Take
the fat from the top of the liquor in which your mutton
was cooked yesterday; put over the fire with the tomatoes
and half a cup of raw rice, and cook slowly one hour.
Season to taste, adding a lump of loaf sugar and a tablespoonful
of butter, rolled in flour; simmer five minutes,
and pour into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmon Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 can preserved salmon.</li>
<li>4 eggs, beaten light.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>4 tablespoonfuls of melted butter.</li>
<li>½ cup fine bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and minced parsley.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the fish fine, rub to a paste with the butter.
Beat the bread-crumbs up with the eggs and seasoning;
work all together; put into a buttered mould, with a tight
top, and boil one hour. Dip in cold water; turn it out
upon a hot dish. Have ready a cupful of drawn butter
with a raw egg beaten into it, and pour over the pudding.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Swiss Turnovers.</span></h3>

<p>Mince the cold mutton left from yesterday. Put half a
cupful of hot water into a saucepan; stir in a great spoonful
of butter, cut up in flour; season with pepper, salt,
and tomato catsup. Pour over a beaten egg, mix well,
and, returning to the saucepan, add the mince, well seasoned
with pepper, salt, a little grated lemon-peel and
nutmeg. Stir up until very hot, but not boiling. Set by
to keep hot while you make a batter of one pint of flour,
four eggs, a little salt, and a quarter spoonful of soda, dissolved
in vinegar, and <i>about</i> four cups of milk—enough
for <i>thin</i> batter. Beat very light. Put a spoonful of lard
(a small one) into a hot frying-pan, run it over the bottom,
turn in a half cupful of batter, and fry quickly. Invert
the pan upon a hot plate, and this, in turn, upon another,
to have the browned side of the pancake downward;
cover the lighter side with the mince; fold up neatly and
lay upon a hot dish in the open oven to keep warm,
while you fry and spread the rest.</p>

<p>They are very nice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare as usual, and pass with both fish and meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce Salad with Cream Dressing.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ cupful of new milk, if you have no cream.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of corn-starch.</li>
<li>Whites of 2 eggs, beaten stiff.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls best salad oil.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls powdered sugar.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of pepper.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of made mustard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk (or cream) almost to boiling; stir in the
corn-starch wet up with cold milk. Boil up, add the
sugar, and take from the fire. Cool, beat in the frothed
whites, oil, pepper, mustard and salt, and, when the lettuce
is shred fine, add the vinegar to the dressing, and
pour over it. Toss up with a silver fork. Eat very soon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wayne Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 full cups of prepared flour.</li>
<li>½ cup of butter.</li>
<li>1 cup of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>1 lemon, the juice and half the grated peel.</li>
<li>½ lb. of citron, cut into very thin strips.</li>
<li>5 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream butter and sugar; add the beaten yolks; whip
up light with the lemon, then add the whites, alternately
with the flour. Butter a mould abundantly, line it with
the strips of citron; put in the batter, a few spoonfuls at
a time; cover and set in a pan of boiling water, in a good
oven. Keep plenty of boiling water in the pan, and cook
steadily one hour and a half. Dip into cold water and
turn out upon a hot plate. Eat warm with wine or brandy
sauce. Leave room in the mould for the pudding to
swell. <i>Never heat a pudding or cake mould before greasing
it or the batter will stick.</i></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ox-tail Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 ox-tail.</li>
<li>2 lbs. of lean beef.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>4 carrots.</li>
<li>3 onions.</li>
<li>Thyme and parsley.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of browned flour.</li>
<li>4 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the tail into joints and fry brown in good dripping.
Slice the onions and two carrots, and fry in the same,
when you have taken out the pieces of tail. When done,
tie them, with thyme and parsley, in a lace bag, and drop
into the soup-pot. Put in the tail, then the beef, cut into
strips. Grate over them the two whole carrots, pour over
all the water, and boil slowly four hours. Strain and
season; thicken with brown flour wet with cold water;
boil fifteen minutes longer, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Irish Stew.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of lean beef—a sirloin steak is best.</li>
<li>8 parboiled potatoes.</li>
<li>2 onions, or one, if it be large, also parboiled.</li>
<li>Browned flour for thickening.</li>
<li>Thyme and sweet marjoram.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>A little pie-paste—not rich—for dumplings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat into pieces an inch wide by two long.
Slice the parboiled potatoes and onions. Put a layer of
meat in a pot; then one of potatoes, next one of onions.
Pepper and salt each sparingly; scatter the herbs upon
the onions; put in more meat, and so on. When all are
in, cover—barely—with cold water, and stew <i>slowly</i> two
hours. Strain out the meat, and put into a covered dish—a
chafing-dish, if you have one. Return the gravy to
the saucepan; thicken with browned flour; cut your paste
into narrow strips two inches long, and drop, one by one,
into the boiling gravy. Stew about eight minutes, and
pour over meat, potatoes, etc., which await it in the dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>To one can of corn add</li>
<li>3 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 cupful of milk.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of sugar.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub butter and sugar together; beat in the eggs; salt
the milk, and put in next; lastly, the corn, drained of
can liquor. Beat up well; pour into a greased bake-dish,
and set, covered, in the oven. At the end of half an hour,
take off the lid, and brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Lyonnaise.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil double the quantity of potatoes required for
your Irish stew, and lay aside eight for this dish. Cut,
when cold, into dice; fry a small chopped onion in a
heaping spoonful of butter, for one minute, then put in
the potatoes. Stir briskly to keep them from browning;
cook until very hot; add a tablespoonful of chopped
parsley; stir a minute longer; turn all into a heated colander;
shake hard to get rid of the grease, and serve hot
in a vegetable-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Queen’s Toast.</span></h3>

<p>Cut slices of stale baker’s bread round with a cake-cutter,
taking off all the crust. Fry in sweet lard to a light
brown. Dip each round quickly into <i>boiling</i> water to remove
the fat. Sprinkle thickly on both sides with a mixture
of powdered sugar and nutmeg, and pile upon a hot
plate. You may dispense with sauce if you will heat a
glass of wine, and put a teaspoonful, or less, upon each
piece, after dipping it into the water, and before sugaring
it. Serve hot.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Réchauffé Soup.</span></h3>

<p>An excellent a soup as ox-tail deserves repetition, and
the probability is that, since Friday is a fast day from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
meat with Roman Catholic servants, you have enough
soup left over for your family proper. Warm it up, making
very hot, but not to boiling. If you like, you can
put some dice of crisp fried bread in the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lobster Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p>To a can of preserved lobster, chopped fine, add pepper,
salt, and powdered mace. Mix with this one-fourth
as much bread-crumbs as you have meat, work in two
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, and make into egg-shaped
rolls. Roll these in raw egg, then in cracker-dust, and
fry in butter or very sweet lard. Serve dry and hot with
cresses or parsley laid around them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chickens with Mushroom Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Split a pair of chickens down the back as for broiling,
and lay in a dripping-pan, with two cups of <i>boiling</i> water,
a little salt, poured over them. Cover very securely with
another pan of the same size—inverted—and cook an
hour and a half if the fowls are of fair size. Baste at
least six times; twice with butter in which has been
mixed a little pepper; three times, copiously, with their
own gravy, and, just before they are done, again with
butter. Boil half a can of mushrooms ten minutes in
clear, hot water. Drain and mince them very fine.
Take up the chickens and keep hot in a covered dish.
Put the gravy into a saucepan; add a little chopped
onion; boil three minutes, thicken with browned flour;
and stir in the chopped mushrooms. Simmer, covered,
five minutes, and pour half over the chickens, the rest
into a sauce-boat. Save all the gravy left after dinner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cabbage Sprouts.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, trim, and boil in hot, salted water, with a bit of
streaked salt pork, an inch square. When tender, drain,
season, and chop fine. Stir in a tablespoonful of melted
butter and the juice of half a lemon. Eat very hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Macaroni.</span></h3>

<p>Break half a pound of pipe macaroni into short lengths.
Cover well with boiling water, salted, and boil—not too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
fast—about twenty minutes, or until tender and clear at
the edges. Drain well; pour a little into a hot, deep
dish, and butter it, then strew with grated cheese. Do
this three times in filling the dish, with cheese scattered
over the top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nursery Plum Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 scant cup of raw rice.</li>
<li>3 pints of milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>½ lb. raisins, seeded, and cut in half.</li>
<li>3 well-beaten eggs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the rice two hours in a farina-kettle, just covered
with warm water. When all the water is soaked up, shake
the rice hard, to reach that at the bottom, and add a pint
of milk. Simmer gently, still in the inner kettle, until the
rice is again dry, and quite tender. Shake up anew, and
add another pint of milk. When this is hot, put in the
raisins, dredged with flour; cover the saucepan and cook
twenty minutes. Turn into a bowl; put with it the butter,
rice-flour, the remaining pint of milk, heated and
mixed with the beaten eggs and sugar, and stir all up
thoroughly. Bake in a buttered pudding-dish, about forty
minutes. Eat warm with butter and sugar, or sugar and
cream.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dresden Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. of lean beef, cut into strips.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>4 pig’s feet, cleaned well.</li>
<li>4 lbs. of mutton and beef bones, cracked.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>1 bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>2 blades of mace.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of butter, and the same of rice-flour.</li>
<li>Juice of a lemon.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce.</li>
<li>1 raw egg for force-meat.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper.</li>
<li>6 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>1 glass of claret.</li>
</ul>

<p>Early in the day, put on the meat, pig’s feet and bones,
and cook slowly five hours in six quarts of water. Skim
then, carefully, add the onions, mace, and herbs, cut
small, and the carrots, <i>grated</i>. Stew half an hour; take
out the meat and the feet, leaving the bones, etc., on the
fire. Cut the flesh from the feet, and return the bones to
the pot. Set aside half this flesh, with a few pieces of
beef, to get cold. Chop the rest fine, and make up with
pepper, salt, and a raw egg, into small force-meat balls.
Roll them in flour, lay upon a greased plate, and set within
the oven to “crust.” When quite firm, take out and
cool. Cut the reserved meat into small, square bits.
When the soup has cooked half an hour after the meat
was taken out, strain and season it. Divide into two
portions. Into that designed for Sunday drop the dice
of meat, from the pig’s feet as well as the beef, and set
away, covered, in an earthenware vessel. Return the
rest to the fire; thicken with the butter, melted and
worked up into the rice-flour; add the sauce, lemon-juice,
and a glass of claret. Put the force-meat balls into
the heated tureen; pour on the soup, cover five minutes,
and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Blue Fish.</span></h3>

<p>Sew up the fish neatly in a thin cloth, put on in scalding
water with a little salt, half a small cup of vinegar, a
quarter of an onion, six whole black peppers, and a blade
of mace. Let it stand, <i>just</i> below boiling heat, half an
hour; then increase the heat and boil thirty minutes more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Take out, unwrap, lay upon a hot dish and pour over it
a cupful of drawn butter, with a little lemon-juice stirred
in it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Calf’s Head.</span></h3>

<p>Put on, having removed the brains, in four quarts of
cold water, and boil gently one hour. Take out the head;
salt and pepper the liquor and set by as the foundation
of Monday’s soup, keeping out a cupful for gravy. Put
the calf’s head in a dripping-pan, rub over with butter,
pour the gravy into the pan, and bake, covered—basting
four times—for half an hour. Uncover, wash over with
a mixture of melted butter, pepper, and salt, and a teaspoonful
of catsup. Dredge with browned flour, baste
again, and when the surface is of a fine froth, dish the
head. Strain and thicken the gravy, and serve in a boat.
The brains should be washed well, boiled quickly, then
cooled; mashed to a smooth paste with pepper, salt, a
dust of flour, and a raw egg, and fried, by the spoonful, in
hot lard. Drain, and lay about the head.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Succotash.</span></h3>

<p>Drain from the liquor; cut the beans—if French or
string beans—into short pieces; cook half an hour in salted
boiling water; drain this off; add a cup of hot milk,
thicken with a great spoonful of butter, cut up in flour,
pepper, and salt, and simmer ten minutes more.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Casserole of Rice with Tomato Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Boil one cup of rice tender in hot water, a little salt,
shaking up from time to time, but never stirring. Drain
dry, add a very little milk in which has been stirred a
beaten egg, a teaspoonful of butter, a little pepper and
salt. Simmer for five minutes, and if the rice has not
absorbed all the milk, drain it again. Pile it around the
inner edge of a flat dish; smooth it neatly, rounding the
top, into a sort of fence; wash over carefully with the
beaten yolks of two eggs, and set it in the oven until firm.</p>

<p>Drain more than half the juice from a can of tomatoes;
season with a little chopped onion, pepper, salt, and
sugar. Stew twenty minutes; stir in a tablespoonful of
butter, and two tablespoonfuls of fine bread-crumbs; stew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
three or four minutes to thicken it well, and pour within
the hedge of rice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Belle’s Dumplings.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart <i>prepared</i> flour.</li>
<li>2½ tablespoonfuls of mixed lard and butter.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk, or enough for soft dough.</li>
</ul>

<p>Roll out a quarter of an inch thick, cut into oblong
pieces, rounded at the corners. Put a great spoonful of
damson, cherry, or other tart preserve, in the middle, and
roll into a dumpling. Bake about forty minutes, brush
over with beaten egg, while hot, and shut up in the oven
three minutes to glaze. Eat hot with brandy sauce. (<i>For
receipt for sauce see Wednesday, 2d Week in January.</i>)</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Clear Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the grease from the soup-jelly you will find in the
crock into which the stock was poured yesterday. Take
it up by the ladleful, leaving the meat and sediment at the
bottom, and put on to heat in a soup-kettle. When it
boils, stir in the beaten white of an egg; take off the scum
as fast as it rises, and when quite clear add two teaspoonfuls
of Coxe’s gelatine, previously soaked in cold water. Add,
meanwhile, a little boiling water to the sediment and meat
dice in the pot; strain off the liquid; pick out the bits of
meat, and see that they are clean. Drop into the soup at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the same time that you add four tablespoonfuls of colored
water, made by burning a tablespoonful or two of sugar in a
tin cup, pouring a little boiling water upon it, and stirring
until you get a clear brown liquor. After these go in,
do not let your soup really boil, but simmer a few minutes
to throw up and remove any remaining scum. Pass sliced
lemon with the soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Chickens—White.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and joint the fowls. Lay in cold salt and
water for one hour. Put them into a pot, with half a pound
of salt pork cut into strips, and cold water enough to cover
them. Cover closely, and heat very slowly to a gentle
boil. The excellence of the fricassee depends mainly upon
care in this respect. If the fowls are full-grown and reasonably
tender, stew more than one hour after they begin
to boil. When done add half a chopped onion, parsley
and pepper. Cover again for ten minutes. Stir up two
tablespoonfuls of flour in cold water, then into a cup of
hot milk, and this, in turn, into two beaten eggs. Then
put in a great spoonful of butter, and pour all into the
saucepan; mix well, boil fairly, and, having arranged the
chickens upon a hot dish, pour the gravy over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Buttered Parsnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil tender and scrape. Slice lengthwise. Put three
tablespoonfuls of butter into a saucepan with pepper, salt
and a little chopped parsley. When it heats, put in the
parsnips, and shake and turn until the mixture boils. Lay
the parsnips in order upon a hot dish, and pour the butter
over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Savory Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and cut into squares some raw potatoes. Lay
in cold water half an hour, put into a saucepan, cover with
boiling water, slightly salted, and stew half an hour, not so
fast as to break them. Then throw off the water and add
a cupful of sauce made from the gravy of Friday’s chickens,
thinned with a little hot water, and strained; seasoned
to taste, and again thickened with a tablespoonful of butter
rolled in flour. Simmer all for ten minutes, and turn into
a deep dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce Salad—Plain.</span></h3>

<p>Wash the lettuce; pull leaf from leaf, and pile over a
lump of ice in a salad-bowl. Pass the oil and vinegar,
salt, pepper, and powdered sugar to each person, with the
lettuce, that he may season for himself.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pie-Plant (April) Fool.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pint of stewed pie plant, rubbed through a colander.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>Yolks of four eggs.</li>
<li><i>Méringue</i> of the whites.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>Juice of half a lemon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the strained pie-plant into a saucepan; set it in
boiling water, and, when hot, beat in the butter, sugar, and
beaten yolks. Stir two minutes, and turn out to cool.
This can be done on Saturday. On Sunday, a few minutes’
whirl of your egg-beater will give you the <i>méringue</i>.
Beat in the powdered sugar with a few more, and when
you have poured the stewed fruit (or vegetable) into a
glass bowl, pile the <i>méringue</i> (the “fool”?) on the top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee and Cake</span></h3>

<p>Can be handed with, or after the sweets.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Milk and Bread Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Boil down the liquor in which Saturday’s calf’s head was
cooked, to less than two quarts. Add a pint of milk previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
heated, and mixed with three beaten eggs. Thicken
with two tablespoonfuls of butter rolled in flour, and take
at once from the fire. Salt and pepper, if needed. Have
ready in a tureen a cupful of fine, dry crumbs. Pour on
the soup, stir up for a moment, cover and send to table
with a plate of grated cheese.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Mutton Chops.</span></h3>

<p>Trim off superfluous fat and skin; beat flat with the
broad side of a hatchet, and lard each with four strips of
fat, salt pork, drawn quite through, so as to project on both
sides. Put into a saucepan, sprinkle with minced onion,
pepper, and parsley, and barely cover with weak broth.
The gravy from yesterday’s chickens will do, or any other
you may chance to have. Put on the saucepan lid, set it
where it will not boil under an hour, and think no more
about it until the time is up. Then increase the heat and
simmer half an hour, or until tender. Take up the chops
and keep hot. Thicken the gravy with browned flour;
add the juice of a lemon, a great spoonful of mushroom
catsup, a glass of sherry, and boil one minute. Put back
the chops; cover, and heat just to a feeble boil. Lay
the chops in order upon a dish and pour the gravy over
them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of peas; turn out into a bowl, and let
alone for an hour. Then, strain off the liquor, put the
peas into a saucepan, and cover with salted, boiling water.
Cook twenty minutes; drain, pepper, stir in a tablespoonful
of butter, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare as usual, and heap in a covered dish. Wet a
pretty butter-print and press firmly upon the top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Meal Hasty Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 heaping cup of Indian meal.</li>
<li>½ cup of flour.</li>
<li>1 quart of boiling <i>milk</i>.</li>
<li>2 cups of boiling water.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of brown sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and mace.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wet up meal and flour with the water and stir into the
boiling milk. Mem.—Cook all sorts of milk-puddings
(boiled) in a farina-kettle. Boil steadily half an hour,
stirring very often from the bottom. Put in salt, sugar,
butter, and spice, and cook ten minutes more. Pour into
a bowl, or other uncovered dish. Eat hot with sugar and
butter.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bean and Corn Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of dried beans, soaked overnight in soft water.</li>
<li>1 lb. of streaked salt pork, cut into shreds.</li>
<li>1 lb. of lean beef also cut up.</li>
<li>2 stalks of celery, minced.</li>
<li>1 bunch of chopped parsley.</li>
<li>1 small onion, sliced.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 can of corn.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter rolled in two of flour.</li>
<li>5 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put on the beans, pork, beef, and all the vegetables
except the corn, with the water, and boil slowly until the
beans are thoroughly broken, and the meat in rags.
Meanwhile, cook the corn tender in just enough boiling
water to cover it. When done, stir in half the butter and
flour, salt and pepper, and cover to keep hot while you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
strain the soup, rubbing the beans, onion, and celery to a
pulp through a colander. Set aside half for to-morrow.
Return the rest to the fire; pepper to taste; add the
corn with the water in which it was cooked. Simmer
fifteen minutes; stir in the rest of the butter and flour;
boil up well, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of prepared flour.</li>
<li>¼ lb. powdered suet.</li>
<li>1 cup of ice-water.</li>
<li>2 lbs. good steak without bone.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of tomato catsup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the suet into the flour, salt slightly, and make, with
the water, into a paste just soft enough to roll out. Roll
into a sheet nearly half an inch thick. Butter well a
round-bottomed pudding mould; line with the paste, and
leave in a cold place while you cut the steak into small
squares, seasoning with pepper, salt, and catsup. Fill the
paste-lined mould (or bowl) with this. Cut a piece of
paste for the top. Cover with this, pinching the two
sheets of paste tightly together at the edges. Let an
assistant hold up the bowl while you cover with a stout
pudding-cloth and tie tightly under the bottom, not straining
the cloth so strongly over the top as to hinder the
paste from swelling. (Flour the cloth before tying it
over the bowl.) Plunge into a gallon of boiling water,
and keep it at a fast boil for two hours, filling up from the
tea-kettle when the water sinks. Turn the bowl bottom
upward and dip in cold water; untie the cloth, invert a
hot dish upon the mould, and turn over carefully, to get
the pudding out without breaking. This is a favorite
English dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Old potatoes, by this time, need a little management to
make them acceptable at a season when appetites crave
fresh vegetables. This is a good way to cook them.
Pare very thin, and leave in cold water one hour. Put
on to cook in <i>cold</i> water, bringing it soon to a boil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
When a fork will run easily into the largest, strain off the
water, throw in a handful of salt, and dry, for a minute,
on the stove. Then take out the potatoes; crack each
one by pressing with a wooden spoon; put into a deep
dish, and pour over them a cup of hot milk thickened with
two tablespoonfuls of butter, cut up in flour; cooked for
a minute, then seasoned with pepper, salt, and a tablespoonful
<i>very</i> finely-minced parsley. Cover the dish; set
in boiling water ten minutes, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil tender; press all the water out in a colander, as
you mash them; return to the fire with a good lump of
butter, pepper, and salt, and stir until smoking hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Slaw.</span></h3>

<p>Shred the heart of a white cabbage, and pour over it
a dressing of two tablespoonfuls of oil, four of vinegar, one
teaspoonful each of salt and sugar, and half as much pepper
and mustard, beaten up well with the whipped yolks
of two eggs. The mixture should be quite thick. Use
an egg-beater in mixing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Chocolate Custards.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>4 great spoonfuls grated chocolate.</li>
<li>Vanilla flavoring.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scald the milk; wet up the chocolate and stir in.
Boil two minutes. Beat the yolks into the sugar, and
pour the hot mixture slowly upon them, stirring constantly.
Season and fill small cups, which should be set
ready in a dripping-pan of boiling water. See that there
is no danger of their boiling over the tops. Cook twenty
minutes, or until the custards are firm. While they cool
whip the whites to a stiff <i>méringue</i> with a little powdered
sugar. When the custards are cold, heap this upon the
tops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fancy Cakes,</span></h3>

<p>Macaroons, lady’s-fingers, or jumbles, should go around
with the custards.</p>

Boiled Cod with Caper Sauce. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scalloped Chicken.<br />

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">“Red Pottage.”</span></h3>

<p>To the bean-stock set by on yesterday add a can of red
tomatoes, cut small, and two lumps of sugar, and simmer,
set in boiling water for fear of burning, until they are one
mass of pulp. Strain through a colander, add seasoning,
and stir in a generous glass of claret which was poured,
two hours before, upon a sliced, deep-colored <i>beet</i>, warm
from the boil. Strain the juice from the beet by squeezing
in a cloth. Put a double-handful of fried bread into
a tureen, and pour the soup upon it.</p>

<p>This, if not “that same red pottage” for which poor
hungry Esau—who certainly came honestly, by hereditary
right, by his love of “good eating”—bartered his birthright,
is yet very pretty and savory.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Cod with Caper Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Sew the fish up neatly in a thin cloth and cook in boiling
water, fifteen minutes to the pound. Unwrap, lay
upon a hot dish, and pour over it the following sauce:</p>

<p>Put a cupful of boiling water into a saucepan, and stir
in two tablespoonfuls of butter, cut up in a heaping teaspoonful
of flour. Beat in, when thick, the whipped yolk
of an egg, the juice of a lemon, and twenty-four capers.
Stir up well, cook half a minute, and take from the fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Chicken.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and cut an old fowl to pieces. Put into a
pot with four quarts of cold water and cook <i>very</i> slowly
until tender. Take it out, salt and pepper the broth, and
put by for to-morrow’s soup, reserving one cupful for your
gravy.</p>

<p>Let the chicken cool, and cut—cleanly—into pieces an
inch long by one fourth that width. Put the gravy, well-seasoned,
over the fire, thicken with a tablespoonful of
butter, cut up and rolled in flour; stir in the chicken, and
just before it boils, take from the fire, and beat in two
whisked eggs, with a little finely minced parsley. Strew
the bottom of a bake-dish with crumbs; pour in the
chicken; cover with a deeper coating of bread-crumbs;
stick bits of butter over this, and bake, covered, until bubbling
hot; then brown delicately.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes—Browned.</span></h3>

<p>Mash soft with milk and butter, season, and round into
a heap upon a greased pie-dish. Brown in a quick oven;
glaze with butter; slip carefully to a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Split Pea Pancakes.</span></h3>

<p>Soak a pint of split peas all night. Put on, in the
morning, in cold water and cook soft. Rub through a
fine colander. While hot, stir in a tablespoonful of butter,
and season with pepper and salt. When quite cold,
beat in two eggs, a cupful of milk, and half a cupful of
flour in which has been sifted—twice—a quarter teaspoonful
of soda and twice as much cream-of-tartar. Beat hard
and long, and fry as you would griddle-cakes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Queen of Puddings.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1½ cups of sugar.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>2 cups of dry bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls vanilla, or other extract—Colgate’s, if you can get it.</li>
<li>1 quart of fresh milk.</li>
<li>½ cup sweet fruit-jelly, or jam.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>Cream butter and sugar and whip in the yolks. Soak
the crumbs in the milk and add next—then flavor. Pour
into a buttered pudding-dish, filling it two-thirds of the
way to the top, and bake until well “set” in the middle.
Draw to the oven door, spread quickly with the jelly, and
this with a <i>méringue</i> of the whites and half a cup of sugar.
Shut the oven and bake quickly until the <i>méringue</i> begins
to color. Eat cold with cream.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the top of the liquor in which your
chicken was boiled yesterday, and put on the soup to
heat. Meanwhile, boil half a cupful of rice tender in a
pint of salted milk, and when the rice is soft, stir in a
tablespoonful of butter worked up in flour to prevent oiling.
When the soup boils up clear, skim and add the
rice and milk, with two tablespoonfuls of minced parsley.
Pepper and salt to taste; simmer ten minutes. Chop up
three hard-boiled eggs fine; put into the tureen and pour
the soup upon them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mayonnaise of Fish.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Yolks of 3 boiled eggs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of best oil.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>1 teaspoonful of salt, and half as much each of pepper and made mustard.</li>
<li>White of 1 raw egg.</li>
<li>2 cupfuls of cold boiled fish (yesterday’s cod).</li>
<li>2 heads of lettuce.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the yolks smooth with the oil, add sugar, salt, pepper,
and mustard, and, when all are mixed, the vinegar,
a little at a time. Set by, covered, while you cut—not
chop—the fish into strips an inch long, and shred the lettuce.
Mix these in a bowl. Whip the frothed white of
egg into the dressing, and pour upon the salad. Stir up
with a silver fork and put into a glass dish. Garnish with
rings of the whites of boiled eggs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Chops with Tomato Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Trim and flatten the chops. Dip in raw egg, then in
cracker dust, and fry, rather slowly, in lard or dripping.
Open a can of tomatoes, and drain off the liquor. Salt
the rest of the tomatoes and reserve for Friday’s soup.
Put the liquor into a saucepan with a sliced onion, and
stew ten minutes. Strain out the onion, return the juice
to the fire; thicken with a great spoonful of butter,
worked up in a teaspoonful of corn-starch; pepper and
salt. Boil up sharply, and when you have laid the chops
upon a dish, pour the sauce over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni with Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Break half a pound of macaroni into short bits; cook
tender in boiling, salted water. Drain well; put into a
deep dish and pour over it a cupful of drawn butter in
which have been stirred two beaten eggs, and two tablespoonfuls
of grated cheese, with salt and pepper. Loosen
the macaroni to allow the sauce to penetrate the mass.
Pass more grated cheese with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Strips.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, cut in long, even strips; lay in cold water for
one hour; dry by spreading them upon a towel and pressing
another upon them. Fry to a light brown in salted lard.
Shake off the fat in a hot colander. Line a deep dish
with a napkin and put in the strips. They should not
be crowded in frying, but each should be distinct and free
from the rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jelly-Cake Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>Cut stale sponge or very plain cup cake into rounds
with a cake-cutter. Fry to a nice brown in sweet lard.
Dip each round in <i>boiling</i> milk, to soften it and get rid
of the grease. Lay upon a hot dish and spread with
sweet jelly or jam. Pile neatly one upon another. Send
around hot, sweetened cream to pour over them.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Graham Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>4 turnips.</li>
<li>½ cabbage.</li>
<li>A little celery-seed tied in a thin muslin bag.</li>
<li>The tomatoes set by yesterday.</li>
<li>½ cup raw rice.</li>
<li>½ cup of cream (with a pinch of soda added to prevent curdling).</li>
<li>2 lumps of white sugar.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and parsley.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of butter cut up in flour.</li>
<li>3 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the cabbage and slice the onions; pare and
<i>grate</i> the other vegetables, and put over the fire with the
rice, the bag of celery-seed, and the water. Stew one
hour; add the tomatoes and stew twenty minutes more.
Rub all to a pulp through a colander; return to the
soup-pot, season, and when it boils, stir in the butter.
Heat the cream to scalding in a separate vessel, and pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
into the tureen. Stir the soup into it by degrees, and
serve. Pass Boston crackers—split and buttered—with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Oysters.</span></h3>

<p>Butter a pudding-dish, and strew the bottom with
rolled cracker. Wet this with oyster-liquor and milk,
slightly warmed. Then lay on oysters, set closely together.
Sprinkle with pepper, salt, and bits of butter,
with a few drops of lemon-juice. Another stratum of
moistened crumbs, and so on, until the dish is full. Let
the top layer be of crumbs, with butter dots here and
there. Bake, covered, half an hour, then brown quickly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Sweetbreads—Brown.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 sweetbreads.</li>
<li>1 cup of gravy (yesterday’s broth will do).</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>½ cup butter.</li>
<li>½ pint of mushrooms.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the sweetbreads quickly—ten minutes are enough—blanch
by throwing them into cold water, then leaving
them to cool. Slice them lengthwise. Slice, also, the
onion and mushrooms, and fry brown in half the butter.
Strain them out, return the fat to the pan, with the rest
of the butter. Heat, and fry the sweetbreads. When
the latter are done, put all into a tin pail, with a tight
top; add the gravy; set, covered, in boiling water, and
stew gently, at the side of the range, half an hour.
Arrange the sweetbreads upon a hot dish; thicken the
gravy with browned flour, and pour over them. Garnish
with triangles of fried bread.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Moulded Potato.</span></h3>

<p>Mash soft with butter and hot milk in which has been
stirred a beaten egg. Salt and put into a buttered cake
or pudding mould. Set in a pan of hot water, put on the
lid of the mould, and keep the water at a hard boil half an
hour. Dip the mould in cold water, and turn out the
potatoes upon a flat dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce.</span></h3>

<p>Treat as directed upon last Sunday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quaking Custard.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 cups of milk.</li>
<li>Yolks of 4 eggs, reserving the whites for the <i>méringue</i>.</li>
<li>½ package Cooper’s gelatine.</li>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>Vanilla flavoring.</li>
<li>Juice of 1 lemon for <i>méringue</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the gelatine two hours in a cup of the cold milk.
Then add to the rest of the milk, which must be boiling hot,
and stir until dissolved. Let it stand a few minutes, and
strain through muslin over the beaten yolks and sugar.
Put over the fire and stir five minutes, or until you can
feel it thickening. Stir up well when nearly cold, flavor,
and let it alone until it congeals around the edges of the
bowl into which you have poured it; then stir again, and
put into a wet mould. Set upon ice, or in cold water
until firm. Turn it, when you are ready for it, into a
glass bowl. Have ready a <i>méringue</i> made by whipping
the whites stiff with three tablespoonfuls of powdered
sugar, and the lemon-juice. Heap irregularly about the
base.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Vermicelli Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 lbs. knuckle of veal.</li>
<li>2 lbs. of coarse, lean beef.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>2 slices of corned ham, or some bones of salt pork.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>Thyme and parsley.</li>
<li>¼ lb. vermicelli.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>6 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Crack the bones into splinters; cut the meat into
strips; slice the onions and chop the herbs. Put on in
six quarts of water, and cook slowly five hours. Strain,
pressing meat, etc., hard in the colander. There should
be about four quarts of soup. Set aside half, when you
have salted it, for Sunday. Return the rest to the clean
kettle, season and skim. The vermicelli should have
been broken small, and boiled in a little hot, salted water,
three minutes. Strain, without squeezing; butter and
pepper; stir into the soup; simmer very gently five minutes,
and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Glazed Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Wash a fine <i>corned</i>—not smoked—ham; soak all night
in cold water, and boil about eighteen minutes to the pound.
There should be plenty of water in the pot, cold at first,
and brought gradually to a boil. Skim well from time to
time. Let it get cold in the water in which it was boiled,
if you can spare the time. <i>We</i> always boil a ham the day
before it is to be eaten. Take it out; remove the skin
carefully, and put the latter back into the cold liquor
when you have skimmed all the fat—which makes excellent
dripping—from the surface of the liquid. Press soft
paper on the top of the ham, to take off the clinging drops
of grease. Brush all over with beaten egg. Work a cup
of rolled cracker into a paste with warm milk, butter, pepper,
salt, and a beaten egg. Coat the ham thickly with
this, and set to brown in a moderate oven. Twist frilled
paper around the knuckle, and garnish with cresses.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach à la Parisienne.</span></h3>

<p>Pick off the leaves from the stalks; put on in boiling
water, a little salt, and cook twenty minutes. Drain hard
and dry, chop fine, return to the fire with a good piece of
butter, a teaspoonful of sugar, a little nutmeg, pepper and
salt, and stir two minutes. Then, beat in two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
tablespoonfuls of cream, or rich milk, and whip as you
would a custard. It should be smooth to taste and sight.
Boil up—barely—and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chow-chow</span></h3>

<p>“Goes well,” as the French say, with ham.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil, peel, and lay in a dripping-pan, with a bit of
butter upon each. As they brown, put on each a teaspoonful
of warm milk mixed with butter, salt, and pepper.
They should be of a light brown. Butter again just before
you dish them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rhubarb Tart.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape the stalks, cut into small bits, and stew in a very
little water. When tender, take from the fire and sweeten.
Have ready some open shells of pastry, freshly baked.
Fill with the fruit, and sift sugar on top. Eat warm or
cold—never <i>hot</i>. Make more paste than you need, and
keep—raw—in a cold place.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pea and Rice Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of green peas, and turn them into a bowl
for an hour. Boil half a cup of rice soft in a cup of milk.
Skim the stock made yesterday, and heat to a boil before
adding the peas (drained) and the rice, which should have
absorbed all the milk. Stew slowly half an hour; add
what seasoning you like, and stir in a tablespoonful of
butter cut up in flour. Simmer five minutes and pour out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fillet of Veal with Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Have the fillet rolled and skewered by your butcher.
Stuff a good force-meat of crumbs and minced fat ham between
the folds of meat, and lay sliced ham over the top
and sides, binding it in place with packthread. Put into
a dripping-pan with a cup of boiling water, and roast
twelve minutes for each pound. Baste very often. Half
an hour before you take it up, remove the ham, and lay
on one side of the pan; dredge the meat with flour and
baste abundantly and frequently until well browned. Dish
with the ham cut into strips and laid next the edge of the
dish—the potato balls close to the meat. Send around
sweet pickles with it. Strain the gravy, thicken with
browned flour, add pepper and a tablespoonful of tomato
catsup; boil up and pour into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Balls.</span></h3>

<p>To one cup of mashed potato add a beaten egg, pepper,
and salt, and work smooth. Make into balls; roll
them in flour. When the veal is half done, skim off the
fat from the gravy, lay the balls in the pan, basting, now
and then, and turning until they are browned all over.
Drain well, and lay about the dished veal.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Cabbage.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a large, firm cabbage, whole, on Saturday, tying
coarse net over it to keep it in shape. Do not remove the
net until next day. Then, bind a broad strip of muslin
about it that it may not crack in the stuffing. Extract
the stalk with a thin, sharp knife. Without making a wide
external aperture, “dig out” the heart, until you have
room for nearly a cupful of force-meat. Chop the bits you
have taken out, mix with cooked sausage-meat, a very little
onion, pepper, salt, a pinch of thyme and bread-crumbs.
Stuff the cabbage with this, remove the band, tie up firmly
again in a net bag, and put it into a pot, covering with the
liquor in which your ham was boiled yesterday, having
first again skimmed the latter. Stew gently one hour.
Take out the cabbage, unbind, with care, and pour a cup
of drawn butter over it. Strain the useful “pot liquor,”
and put away heedfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">French Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Cut into short lengths, when you have poured off the
can liquor; cook half an hour in boiling water, salted.
Drain well, stir up with a tablespoonful of butter, with
pepper and salt to taste.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Charlotte Cachée.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 thick loaf of sponge or plain cup cake.</li>
<li>2 kinds of fruit-jelly, tart and sweet.</li>
<li>Whites of 5 eggs.</li>
<li>1 heaping cup of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>Juice of 1 lemon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the cake into horizontal slices of uniform width.
Spread each with jelly—first, the tart, then the sweet, and
fit into their former places. Ice thickly with a frosting
made of the whites, sugar, and lemon-juice. Set in a
sunny window, or slow oven, to harden. The former is
the better plan.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bird’s Nest in Jelly.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of wine jelly—not too thin.</li>
<li>3 cups of white blanc-mange.</li>
<li>9 empty egg-shells.</li>
<li>Rind of 2 oranges cut into strips and stewed in water, until tender, then in syrup until clear, or, if you have it, use preserved orange-peel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Empty the eggs carefully through a hole in the small
end; wash them out with cold water, and while wet inside
set firmly in a pan of bran or meal, to keep them steadily
upright. Fill them with blanc-mange. Next morning, fill
a glass dish two-thirds full with clear jelly, reserving a
large cupful. So soon as the jelly is firm enough to bear
their weight, break the shells, with care, from the blanc-mange
eggs, and pile them upon the jelly. Lay the
“straw”—<i>i. e.</i>, the orange-peel—over and about them;
pour the rest of the half congealed jelly over all, and set
in a <i>very</i> cold place.</p>

<p>A beautiful variation of this dessert can be made for Easter
Sunday, by coloring part of the blanc-mange brown with
chocolate, part pink with currant jelly or cranberry juice,
part yellow with yolk of egg, and leaving the rest white.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ham and Egg Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Skim once more and re-heat the liquor in which your
ham was cooked, and, when boiling, take off the scum;
stir in two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch, wet in a half cup
of milk. Take out a pint of the soup, and pour slowly,
stirring well, upon four beaten eggs. Return to the soup,
with a handful of very finely minced parsley. Stir one
minute, without letting it boil, and pour upon half a dozen
split Boston crackers, lining the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Patés.</span></h3>

<p>Chop up the meat left from Sunday’s fillet—reserving
some for salad—also the crisped ham. Season well,
warm up the gravy, when you have removed the fat; mix
a little oyster liquor with it, and stir in the mince. Heat
<i>almost</i> to boiling, and set by, covered, where it will keep
warm. Line <i>paté</i>-pans with the paste reserved for this
purpose from Saturday. If kept in the refrigerator or
cool cellar, it will be perfectly good. Bake these
“shells,” buttering the tins well; slip out while hot; arrange
on a warm dish; fill with the mince, sprinkling the
top of each with fine, dry crumbs; set upon the upper
grating of your oven for a minute or so, and send to
table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Creamed Parsnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, scrape, and slice lengthwise. Have ready in a
saucepan a great spoonful of butter, with pepper and salt.
Put in the parsnips, shake and turn until very hot; lay
the parsnips upon a dish; add to the sauce three tablespoonfuls
of cream, or four of milk, in which has been
rubbed a teaspoonful of flour. Boil up briskly, and pour
over the sliced vegetable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salad of Lettuce and Veal.</span></h3>

<p>Cut half a pound of your cold veal into inch-long
strips, and strew with salt and pepper. Shred a head of
lettuce, and chop two boiled eggs—not too finely. Mix
these together in a bowl. Prepare a dressing thus: Beat
the yolks of two eggs (add the whites to the soup); salt
lightly, and beat in, a few drops at a time, four tablespoonfuls
of oil; then, as gradually, three teaspoonfuls of
best vinegar, and half a teaspoonful of celery essence—Colgate’s,
if you can get it. The mixture should be thick
as cream. Pour over the meat and lettuce, toss up with
a silver fork, and transfer to a glass dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare as often before directed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Starch Hasty Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of fresh milk.</li>
<li>3 full tablespoonfuls of corn-starch.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scald the milk, and stir in the corn-starch, previously
wet in cold water to a white liquid. Boil steadily, stirring
constantly, ten minutes. Salt and butter. Let the
pudding stand three minutes in hot water, after you take
it from the fire, and turn out into a deep, open dish.
Cook, of course, in a farina-kettle.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mélange Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of rice (scant).</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>3 lbs. of coarse, lean beef.</li>
<li>Some mutton bones.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>Essence of celery, two teaspoonfuls.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>4 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>1 cup of tomato-juice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat into dice, and put on in the water. Boil
gently two hours, when add the rice, tomato-juice, and the
vegetables cut into small squares, and already cooked five
minutes in hot water, to take off the rank taste. Stew half
an hour, or until the vegetables and rice are tender, but not
a pulp; season; boil up once and pour out—meat, vegetables,
and all—into the tureen.</p>


<h3>Ragoût of Mutton.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of mutton—lean and boneless—cut into strips four inches long by one inch wide.</li>
<li>1 cup of gravy, made of bones, etc.</li>
<li>A tablespoonful of walnut catsup.</li>
<li>Browned flour.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper.</li>
<li>1 slice of lemon.</li>
<li>Parsley.</li>
<li>A slice of ham or fat pork, cut small.</li>
<li>Dripping.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fry the mutton to a nice brown, quickly, in the dripping.
Lay in a saucepan, the chopped ham upon it, and
cover with the gravy, highly seasoned. Stew slowly until
very tender; take up, and keep hot, while you add the
lemon to the gravy, with the catsup. Boil five minutes;
strain, and return the gravy to the saucepan. Thicken,
and put in the parsley minced fine. Boil up, and pour
over the meat in a flat dish. Put sippets of fried bread
around the edge of the dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Corn Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 can of corn, drained.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of sugar.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
<li>2 cupfuls of milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of corn-starch, wet up in the milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat eggs, sugar, and butter together; then add the
corn. Salt the milk, and dissolve the corn-starch well in
it, and pour, by degrees, upon the rest, mixing well.
Bake in a greased bake-dish three-quarters of an hour.
Keep covered until nearly done; then, brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Drain off the liquor from a can of tomatoes, and put it
into your soup. Pare the crust from some slices of
bread, cut them to fit the bottom of a greased pie-dish,
and fry to a light brown in dripping. Dip each in boiling,

<h3><span class="smcap">Eel Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 lbs. of eels.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>12 whole peppers.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>Tablespoonful of chopped parsley.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of flour, rubbed into the butter.</li>
<li>2 quarts of water.</li>
<li>2 slices of toast cut into strips.</li>
<li>Dripping.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clean the eels with care, removing all the fat; cut
them into short pieces, and fry for five minutes in dripping.
Drain, put into a saucepan with the water, onion, and
pepper, and stew slowly one hour, or until they are tender,
without breaking. Strain through a colander; pick
out the eels and cover in a tureen, the bottom of which
is lined with strips of buttered toast. Strain the soup,
through a soup-sieve, back into the saucepan; heat, and
stir in butter, flour, and parsley. Boil up, add the milk,
already heated, and pour over the eels and toast.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Chicken.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and stuff as for roasting. Bind legs and wings to
the sides; tie in a net, and put on in boiling water—if
tender. If doubtful, use cold water, and cook very slowly.
When the fork-test shows that it is done, unwrap and
lay on a dish. Salt, pepper, and butter well, and cover
while preparing the sauce. Take out a cup of the liquor,
cool, and skim, put on in a saucepan; put in a tablespoonful
of butter, rolled in flour, and stir to a boil. Take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
off, and pour gradually over two beaten eggs. Return to
the fire, with minced parsley, <i>almost</i> boil, and pour over
the fowl.</p>

<p>Salt the liquor and set aside for soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Crème.</span></h3>

<p>Mash thin, whip up with a fork, at first, with butter,
salt, and milk; at last, with the frothed white of an egg.
Heap roughly upon a dish, set upon the upper grating of
the oven until they begin to color, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Croquettes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups cold boiled rice.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls melted butter.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of flour.</li>
<li>1 raw egg, and some cracker dust.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>A pinch of grated lemon peel, and the same of nutmeg.</li>
<li>Lard for frying.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work the butter into the rice, then the seasoning,
lastly, the beaten eggs. Make into long balls, roll in
egg, then in powdered cracker, and fry, a few at a time,
in hot lard.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Steamed Corn-Meal Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups Indian meal.</li>
<li>1 cup of flour.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of white sugar.</li>
<li>2½ cups of “loppered” milk, or buttermilk.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of soda, sifted twice through the flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>1 heaping tablespoonful of butter, melted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put meal, flour, salt, sugar, and soda in a bowl; mix
thoroughly; make a hole in the middle and work in the
milk and butter. Beat hard and long when all are in;
put into a buttered mould with a tight top, and steam one
hour and a half. If you have no regular steamer, fit the
mould in the top of a pot of boiling water, taking care it
does not hang into the water. Lay a thick wet towel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
folded, over the top of the mould to keep in all the heat.
Or, you may simply boil it. Eat hot, with butter and
sugar.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Almond Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Broth in which yesterday’s chickens were boiled.</li>
<li>½ lb. of almonds.</li>
<li>1 cup rich milk—half cream, if you can get it.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter, rubbed up with two of flour.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>3 boiled eggs.</li>
<li>2 blades of mace.</li>
</ul>

<p>Skim and heat the soup. Meanwhile, blanch (that is,
scald and skin) the almonds, and pound in a mortar. Rub
to a powder the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, and work
up, with the butter, flour, and almonds, to a paste. When
the soup boils, pepper and salt, and put in the mace.
Skim clean, strain out the mace; return to the pot and
stir in the paste of almonds, etc. Boil up gently, have
the milk scalding hot in the tureen, and pour in the soup,
mixing all up well. Serve at once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak.</span></h3>

<p>Flatten with the broad side of a hatchet; broil over (or
under) a clear fire upon a buttered gridiron—turning
often. Lay upon a hot dish; salt, pepper, and butter,
plentifully. Cover with a hot dish or lid, and let it stand
five minutes to draw out the juices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chopped Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Chop cold boiled potatoes into dice. Put some butter
or nice dripping into a frying-pan; heat, and stir in the
potatoes. Shake to prevent them from sticking to the
pan, and when very hot, and glazed with the butter,
pepper and salt, and turn into a hot colander. Shake
and toss for a moment, and pour into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the meat from the “carcasses” of yesterday’s
chickens. If you have but a little it may be worth while
to give John a piquant side-dish. Add an equal quantity
of shred lettuce, when you have cut your chicken into
narrow strips, two inches long. Mix in a bowl; prepare
a dressing according to the receipt given on Monday;
pour over it, mix well and lightly; put into a salad-dish,
and lay sections of two hard-boiled eggs on top, with a
chain of sliced whites—left from the yolks used for the
soup—around the outer edge.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Moulded Spinach.</span></h3>

<p>Boil twenty minutes in hot, salted water; drain, pressing
hard. Chop <i>fine</i>, and put into a saucepan, with a
good lump of butter, a little pepper, salt and sugar. Beat
and toss until nearly dry. Press hard into an oblong pan
or mould. Invert this upon a hot dish. Lay slices of
egg upon the top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soft Gingerbread.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 cup of molasses.</li>
<li>1 cup of butter.</li>
<li>1 cup of sweet milk.</li>
<li>4 cups of flour.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful mixed ginger and mace.</li>
<li>1 small teaspoonful of soda dissolved in the milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat molasses, butter, sugar, and spice to a cream; whip
in the beaten yolks, the milk, and lastly, the whites,
alternately with the flour. Bake in two loaves, or in
round tins or cups.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate.</li>
<li>2 cups of boiling water and the same of milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wet the chocolate in cold water; stir into the hot.
Boil fifteen minutes; add the milk, and simmer ten minutes
longer. Sweeten upon the fire, or as you pour it
out.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 quarts of oysters.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>1 teacupful of water.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>Cayenne pepper, salt, mace.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of corn-starch.</li>
</ul>

<p>Strain the liquor from the oysters into a saucepan, mixing
in the water. Season and spice to taste. When the
liquor boils, add a quarter of the oysters chopped fine. Boil
five minutes; strain through muslin and put back into
the saucepan. Thicken with the butter rubbed up in a
tablespoonful of corn-starch. When this boils, drop in
the whole oysters. Cook until they “ruffle.” Meanwhile,
make a sugarless custard by heating and salting the
milk, adding the beaten eggs, and stirring four minutes
over the fire. Put some split crackers into the tureen;
pour on the custard, then the oyster-soup, stirring all up
well. Send around oyster crackers and sliced lemon with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fillets of Halibut.</span></h3>

<p>Cut a tolerably thick halibut steak into strips four
inches long by two wide. Put three tablespoonfuls of
butter, with pepper and salt, into a saucepan, and simmer
gently—not frying—until tender. Then drain, and put
upon a hot water dish to keep hot. Cut some potatoes
into small balls. There is a little instrument for this purpose,
like a rounded gouge, which turns them out rapidly
and neatly. A <i>small</i> iron spoon will give you oval balls.
Or, if you find it easier, cut the potatoes into equal cubes;
lay in cold water half an hour, then cook fifteen minutes
in boiling water. Drain and dry, and after taking your fish
from the butter, strain the latter, put in the potatoes, and
shake over a hot fire until they begin to brown. Drain,
and lay about the fish-fillets. Add a tablespoonful of
butter to that in the pan (previously cut up in flour), a
teaspoonful of anchovy-sauce, and the juice of a lemon,
with a little minced parsley. Boil once, and pour over
fish and potatoes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Paté of Sweetbreads.</span></h3>

<p>Cut good puff-paste into rounds a quarter of an inch
thick. Reserve one of these for the bottom of each paté.
With a smaller cutter take out the centre of three others
and pile upon this, making a deep well over an inch
across. Bake quickly, glazing with white of egg when
nearly done.</p>

<p>Boil three sweetbreads ten minutes, leave in cold
water as long; cut into dice, put into a saucepan with a
great spoonful of butter, a little pepper and salt, and a few
spoonfuls of boiling water, and stew twenty minutes.
Stir, meanwhile, into half a cup of boiling milk a tablespoonful
of butter, cut up in as much flour. Add to the
sweetbreads with a little minced parsley. Boil up. Fill
the patés, and arrange upon a heated dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>If dried, soak over night, put on next day in cold
water, salted, and cook gently until soft. Drain, stir in
butter and pepper. If you use the canned beans, put
on in boiling water, then proceed as above directed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boston Cream Cakes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ lb. of butter.</li>
<li>¾ lb. of flour.</li>
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>1 pint water—warm—not scalding.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir the butter into the warm water, and heat slowly to
a boil. Then put in the flour, boil and stir one minute;
empty into a dish to get cold. Beat the eggs light, and
whip, first the yolks, then the whites, into the cooled
paste. Drop in great spoonfuls, upon buttered paper,
not letting them touch each other, and bake, in a quick
oven, ten minutes. They should puff up to quadruple
their original size. Pass a sharp knife lightly around
each, split, and fill with the following mixture:</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>2 cups of sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful butter.</li>
<li>Vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat three cups of milk, and stir in the corn-starch wet
with the other cupful. Beat the eggs and sugar together,
and add the boiling mixture, by degrees. Put in the
butter; mix well and cool before adding the vanilla.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soup Verte.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. coarse beef, chopped fine.</li>
<li>1 turnip.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>1 onion.</li>
<li>Celery-seed tied in a bag.</li>
<li>1 grated carrot.</li>
<li>Nearly a quart of spinach leaves.</li>
<li>2 lumps of sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter, rubbed in flour.</li>
<li>Bunch of parsley.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>A little of yesterday’s pastry, cut into strips—like “noodles.”</li>
<li>2 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stew the beef with the celery-seed in a quart of water
for two hours, or until the meat is in rags. Strain <i>hard</i> in
a bag. Add the other quart of water in which have been
simmering, for half an hour, the grated carrot, the spinach
cut small, and the other vegetables sliced. Stew all together
fifteen minutes; rub <i>entirely</i> through a colander;
return to the fire, season; add sugar, chopped parsley,
butter and flour; boil up and drop in the noodles, one
by one. Simmer ten minutes, and pour out. It is a very
good and wholesome soup for the spring-time.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Mutton Cutlets.</span></h3>

<p>Trim neatly and put the bits of bone, skin, etc., on in
a pint of cold water to stew down into gravy. Pour a
little melted butter upon the cutlets and set over hot
water, fifteen minutes. Then dip each in egg, next in
rolled cracker, and lay in your dripping-pan with a very
little water. Bake rapidly, basting with butter and water.
When the gravy has boiled down to one cupful, strain into
a saucepan; season with pepper, salt, and tomato catsup.
Thicken with browned flour; strain into it the gravy from
the dripping-pan; lay the chops carefully in a frying-pan,
as being broad and easily managed. Pour over them the
gravy, simmer ten minutes; arrange the chops upon a
dish, and serve the gravy in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hominy Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cupful cold boiled hominy—the small-grained kind.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>1 great spoonful of melted butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of white sugar.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work the butter into the hominy; then the beaten
yolks and sugar; then, by degrees, the milk, and when
all are smoothly mixed, the whites. Bake in a buttered
pudding-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Cakes.</span></h3>

<p>Make cold mashed potatoes into flat cakes, seasoning
well, and flouring all over. Fry to a good brown in dripping.
Take up and drain as soon as they are done, and
serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and pile the best parts in a salad-dish. Pass oil,
vinegar, pepper, salt, and powdered sugar to each one
and let him season for himself. It is well to do this, once
in a while, that the children may learn how to prepare
their own salad.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tapioca Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of tapioca.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter, and the same of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the tapioca in cold water three hours; drain off
the water, if it be not all absorbed. Soak another hour in
the warmed milk. Then, beat eggs and sugar up with the
butter, add the milk and tapioca, stir up well from the
bottom, after it goes into the oven, and bake in a buttered
pudding-dish until firm and nicely browned. Eat warm
with sweet sauce. It is also good cold, eaten with sugar
and cream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Head Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>The liquor in which a calf’s head has been boiled.</li>
<li>1 lb. of lean beef cut into dice and fried brown.</li>
<li>3 sliced and fried onions.</li>
<li>1 grated carrot.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter rubbed warm into the same quantity of browned flour.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce.</li>
<li>1 glass brown sherry.</li>
<li>Dice of meat from the head.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil a calf’s head on Saturday until the flesh slips from
the bones. Salt and pepper the meat and set away, with
the brains—also salted and cooked—in a cool place. Return
the bones to the liquor with the vegetables and herbs
cut small, the fried beef and onions, and boil one hour.
Season highly and put by in a cool cellar until Sunday.
Take off the fat, and melt the soup-jelly under it by heating
all together in a soup-kettle. When hot, strain, and
set aside half the stock for Monday. Boil up that meant
for to-day, stir in the butter and flour, and a cupful of dice
made from one cheek of the cold head. Simmer ten
minutes, add sauce and wine, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Imitation Turtle.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>The cold calf’s head, with the tongue.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>1 cup of good gravy. If you have nothing else, borrow a cupful from your soup-jelly.</li>
<li>A dozen force-meat balls, made of the ears chopped fine, mixed with bread-crumbs, bound with beaten egg and rolled in flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful minced parsley and thyme.</li>
<li>A little minced onion.</li>
<li>Browned flour.</li>
<li>4 hard-boiled eggs.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Slice the meat from the head neatly. Heat the gravy
with seasoning, herbs, and onion, and boil ten minutes.
Strain; put the meat into the saucepan; pour the gravy
over it, and set all in boiling water fifteen minutes. Put
over the fire with the sliced eggs and force-meat balls.
Let them begin to boil, and take off. Lay the meat
evenly upon a dish, and the eggs upon it, the force-meat
balls around all, and pour half the gravy over it, sending
up the rest in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chopped Macaroni.</span></h3>

<p>Boil half a pound of macaroni tender in hot salted water,
and let it cool. Then chop small. Have ready in a
saucepan a cupful of hot milk in which an onion has been
boiled and strained out. Stir into this a great spoonful
of butter, pepper, salt, and two tablespoonfuls of
grated cheese. When these are well mixed, put in the
macaroni, and shake—not stir—until very hot. Turn into
a deep dish, and grate more cheese on the top. Pass a
red-hot shovel over this until the cheese browns—or if
dry, takes fire. Blow it out, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String-Beans and Fried Brains.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the beans into short lengths and cook in boiling
water salted. Drain, stir in butter, pepper, and salt, and
dish. Garnish with the brains, rubbed smooth, seasoned,
beaten up with a raw egg and a little flour, and fried by
the spoonful in hot fat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bermuda Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Put on in boiling water; cook until a fork will go in
easily; dry off, and serve in their skins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Alice’s Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup dry crumbs.</li>
<li>½ cup of strawberry or other sweet jam.</li>
<li>½ cup of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sprinkle the bottom of a buttered bake-dish with
crumbs. Pour in the jam, and cover this with the rest of
the crumbs, wet with a little milk. Scald the remainder
of the milk, and pour, gradually, upon the beaten eggs
and sugar. Heat and stir three minutes; put it, spoonful
by spoonful, upon the crumbs, so as not to displace them,
and when all is in, bake until well set and slightly colored
by the heat. Eat cold—with cream, if you can get it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee and Whipped Cream.</span></h3>

<p>Whip a little cream in a syllabub churn, and lay a spoonful
upon the surface of each cup of made coffee.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Good White Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Skim the stock set aside yesterday; heat and season,
then strain through thin muslin, and return to the fire.
Skim again; add a great spoonful of butter, cut up in
flour, and boil up. Have ready in your tureen a cupful
of hot milk, in which has been soaked half a cupful of
bread-crumbs; beat into these the whites of two eggs;
pour in the soup, by degrees, stirring in well, and serve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ham and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Cut slices of ham of equal size; cover with boiling
water, and cook ten minutes, then let them get cold.
Cut off the rind and fry in their own fat, until browned.
Lay upon a hot dish; strain the fat, returning it to the
pan with a little butter, and when hot break in the eggs.
Fry upon one side; trim off the ragged edges, and lay
upon the ham. Dust with pepper, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Succotash.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of succotash; drain off the liquor, cut the
beans into short lengths, and put on in boiling water,
salted. Cook twenty-five minutes; drain off the water,
and add as much cold milk. When this is hot, stir in a
great spoonful of butter, cut up in flour; pepper and salt,
cook three minutes more and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the oysters into thirds; pull the hearts out of nice
lettuce heads and shred up one-third as much as you have
oysters. Make a dressing in the proportion of two tablespoonfuls
of best oil to four of vinegar; one teaspoonful
of salt and the same of sugar; half as much pepper,
and made mustard. Rub all up well, and pour over
oysters and lettuce just before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Cut into small squares and put on in boiling water,
slightly salted. When tender, but not broken, throw off
half the water, and proceed as with the succotash, only
adding a teaspoonful of finely minced parsley.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Plain Macaroni Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ lb. macaroni, broken in pieces an inch long, boiled tender (or about twenty minutes) in hot, salted water.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>1 large cup of milk.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>2 tablespoonfuls powdered sugar.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>Grated peel of half a lemon.</li>
<li>A little cinnamon and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the macaroni is tender, drain off the water and
add the salt and butter. Heat the milk and pour over
the beaten eggs, sugar and flavoring. Mix with the macaroni,
and bake in a buttered pudding-dish, covered, for
half an hour; then brown. Eat with butter and sugar.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pot-au-feu.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of lean beef, cut into dice.</li>
<li>1 sliced and fried onion.</li>
<li>2 carrots, cut into small squares.</li>
<li>2 turnips, ditto.</li>
<li>1 bunch of sweet herbs, minced.</li>
<li>2 potatoes, parboiled and sliced.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put on the beef in two quarts of water and cook slowly
until it is tender, and the water reduced to one quart.
Put the vegetables—except the potatoes—on in boiling
water. Cook ten minutes; throw away the water and
cover with a quart of cold. Add the potatoes; pepper
and salt and cook gently half an hour. Put in the meat
and the quart of gravy and simmer ten minutes more,
with the minced herbs. Then pour out. This is only a
family soup, but is a good one when properly cooked.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Leg of Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Do not have the shank too long, nor cut it so short as
to make the leg “chunky.” The meat will look cleaner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and less sodden if you boil it in a piece of mosquito net
or tarlatan, sewed about it somewhat tightly. Put on in
boiling salted water, plenty of it, and cook fifteen minutes
to the pound. Unwrap and lay upon a hot dish. Butter
all over, and sprinkle lightly with salt. Twist frilled paper
about the end of the shank.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Caper Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Take out a cupful of the liquor in which the mutton
was boiled (putting away the rest for soup), strain, heat,
and skim; stir in two tablespoonfuls of butter rubbed in
a teaspoonful of flour; pepper, boil up, pour upon a
beaten egg; return to the fire and stir for a minute; add
two dozen capers or nasturtium-seed, and pour into a
sauce-boat. Pass, of course, with the mutton.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Lyonnaise.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil the potatoes, and cut into dice. Chop a small
onion and mince a tablespoonful of parsley. Put two
tablespoonfuls of butter or excellent dripping into a frying-pan,
and when hot, stir in potatoes, onion, and parsley.
Shake and toss until all are hissing hot, but do not let
them brown. Shake off the fat in a hot colander, and
serve in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Pie-Plant.</span></h3>

<p>Skin and wash the stalks, and cut into half inch lengths.
Stew tender in a little water, with a handful of seedless
raisins. Sweeten to taste. Eat cold with meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Lèche Crèma.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 can of peaches.</li>
<li>Yolks of 3 eggs and whites of four.</li>
<li>3 cups of milk.</li>
<li>½ cup of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of melted butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scald the milk; stir in the corn-starch wet with cold
milk, and cook, still stirring, until it begins to thicken.
Take from the fire, and beat in the butter, then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
whipped yolks, two whites and sugar. Whisk to a
light cream. Drain the syrup from the peaches; lay
them in the bottom of a bake-dish, and pour the mixture
gently over them. Bake in a quick oven ten minutes,
then spread with a <i>méringue</i> of four whites whisked stiff
with a little sugar. Shut up in the oven until this is
slightly tinged. Eat warm with sauce, or cold with cream.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Scotch Broth.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the top of the broth in which the
mutton was boiled yesterday. Chop up an onion, a good
sized one, and put in it. Boil half an hour and strain.
Add a cup of barley, previously soaked two hours in cold
water, and cook for two hours more. Chop up some
parsley fine and add. When the barley is very soft, and
the broth has boiled down one-half, pour out and serve,
having peppered to taste.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the meat from yesterday’s mutton, into strips two
inches long by half an inch wide. Chop a pickled cucumber
to pieces, also two boiled eggs. Put a layer of
meat in a bake-dish, strew with pickle and egg; salt and
pepper and drop, pretty thickly, over it, bits of butter
rolled in flour. Go on in this order, until your meat is
used up, when pour in a cup of oyster-liquor or cold
water. Cover with a good crust, ornamented around the
edges; make a slit in the middle, and bake one hour.</p>

<p>N. B.—The bare bones will “help out” to-morrow’s
soup.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Receipts for these, as also for plain mashed potatoes,
have been given so lately that repetition here is needless.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cabbage Salad.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 small, firm white cabbage, shred fine.</li>
<li>1 cup of boiling milk.</li>
<li>1 smaller cup of vinegar, also hot.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter, and the same of sugar.</li>
<li>2 eggs, well beaten.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful essence of celery.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the vinegar boils, put in butter, sugar, and seasoning.
Boil, and add the shred cabbage. When this is
scalding hot, take from the fire. Pour the hot milk upon
the eggs, and cook one minute, stirring constantly. Turn
the cabbage into a bowl, pour over it the smoking custard,
toss up and mix well, and set it, covered, in ice-cold
water. Eat perfectly cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Puffs.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of prepared flour.</li>
<li>½ cup of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>3 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
<li>Grated peel of 1 lemon.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of milk.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream butter and sugar, whip in the yolks, milk, and
lemon-peel; then, the whisked whites and flour, alternately.
Bake in small, buttered tins, or in “gem” pans.
Turn out while hot, and eat with sweet sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soup à la Bonne Femme.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Bones of cold mutton, cracked.</li>
<li>2 lbs. of lean veal from the knuckle, bones broken, and meat cut up.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter, rubbed in flour.</li>
<li>½ cup of raw rice.</li>
<li>½ cup of milk.</li>
<li>1 onion, chopped.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>Minced parsley.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put bones, meat, onion, and rice on in the cold water,
and cook slowly three hours. Strain, rubbing the rice
and onion to a pulp, through a coarse sieve. Season,
boil up, skim, and stir in parsley and butter. Heat the
milk, pour upon the beaten eggs, and add to the soup,
stirring in well. Let it <i>almost</i> boil, and take from the
fire. Pour out, and serve at once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corned Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Wash the beef well, put on in plenty of boiling water,
and cook at least eighteen minutes to the pound, if the
piece be tolerably thick. Put away the liquor for to-morrow.
Dish the meat. Make a sauce as directed on
Tuesday, for mutton, but substituting pickled cucumber,
chopped, and a very little pickled onion, for the capers.
Serve in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>At this season the yellow turnips are best. Put on,
when you have pared and quartered them, in cold water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
salted, and cook tender. Mash, and press out the water;
stir in a good piece of butter; pepper and salt to taste,
and dish very hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Cauliflower.</span></h3>

<p>The cauliflowers in market now are less nice than those
to be had earlier, or later in the year. Still, you can get
them, now and then. Boil, tied in a net, in hot water.
Clip into neat clusters, and set, stems downward, in a
buttered bake-dish. Beat up a cupful of bread-crumbs to
a soft paste with two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, and
four of milk. Season with pepper and salt, and whip in
a raw egg. Butter, salt, and pepper the cauliflower, and
pour the mixture over it. Cover closely, and bake ten
minutes, or until very hot, in a brisk oven; then brown
lightly and rapidly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, pare, and slice round, very thin. Leave in cold
water one hour; wipe, by spreading upon one towel, and
pressing another upon it, and fry, not too many at a time,
in boiling lard, salted. Cook quickly, take out with a
wire spoon, and shake in a hot colander. Serve in a
deep dish lined with a hot napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Cream Pie.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 teacup of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>1 egg.</li>
<li>1 orange—juice and half the grated peel soaked together, for half an hour, then squeezed in a muslin bag.</li>
<li>1 teacupful boiling water.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of corn-starch, dissolved in cold water.</li>
<li>Pulp of half an orange.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir the corn-starch into the water; cream the butter
and sugar, and pour over them the hot mixture. Cool,
and add the orange and beaten egg. Take the inner rind
from the half-orange, remove the seeds, and chop <i>very</i>
fine. Bake in open shells.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">“Peas Porridge Hot.”</span></h3>

<p>Soak a quart of split peas all night. In the morning
put on in the liquor from your corned beef, with a sliced
onion and a little celery-seed, tied in thin muslin. The
liquor should be skimmed and poured cold upon the peas.
Cook slowly, until these are soft enough to pulp through
a colander. Rub them; if the soup be very salt, add
hot water; pepper to taste; boil up, and stir in a cup of
hot milk, in which have been dissolved two tablespoonfuls
of corn-starch, wet up in water, and a tablespoonful of
butter. Add minced parsley; simmer two minutes;
have a double handful of fried bread dice in the tureen,
and pour on the soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Shad.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and wipe a large shad. Stuff with a dressing
of bread-crumbs, butter, salt, and pepper, wet with
milk, and sew up carefully with fine cotton. Lay in the
dripping-pan; pour over it a cupful of hot water, and
bake one hour, covered, except when you are basting it
with butter and water. Put into a hot dish, and keep
warm, while you add to the gravy a teaspoonful of anchovy
sauce, the juice of a lemon, a tablespoonful of
browned flour, wet up with cold water, and pepper. Boil
up well, and serve in a boat. Garnish the fish with sliced
lemon, and pass the cress-salad with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Miroton of Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Chop your cold corned beef fine. Have ready in a
saucepan a cup of drawn butter, into which stir a teaspoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of minced onion, the yolk of a boiled egg, pounded, and
a beaten raw egg. Boil gently three minutes, and add the
mince of beef. Stir until hot, but not boiling; pour into
a bake-dish; spread with a cover of mashed potatoes,
into which have been worked half a cup of milk and a
great spoonful of butter. Brown in a good oven, and
glaze with butter, when it begins to color well. Serve in
the dish. It is very good.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cresses.</span></h3>

<p>Pick over, wash, and cut into small pieces. Pile in a
salad-bowl, and season with vinegar, salt, pepper, and a
little sugar, mixing in well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach with Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the leaves from the stems, and cook twenty minutes
in boiling, salted water. Drain and chop <i>very</i> fine
upon a board or chopping-tray. Return to the fire with a
good spoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of sugar; salt and
pepper to taste. Heat, stirring constantly and beat in the
yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, rubbed to a fine powder.
When well mixed, turn the spinach into a deep dish and
garnish with a chain of sliced whites laid on top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">An Ambushed Trifle.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>A round, stale sponge-cake.</li>
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of corn-starch.</li>
<li>1 cup of sweet jelly or jam.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>Vanilla flavoring.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the top carefully from the cake in one piece.
Scoop out the inside of the loaf, leaving side-walls and
bottom an inch thick. Coat these with the jelly. Heat
the milk; beat eggs and sugar, with the cake-crumbs, and
pour on the hot milk. Stir over the fire until thick, and
add the corn-starch wet up with cold milk. Cook one
minute and turn out. When cold, flavor and fill the cake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
with it. Coat the inside of the lid with jelly, and fit into
its place; brush the whole cake with white of egg, sift
powdered sugar over it, and set in a cool, dry place until
wanted.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clam Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Strain the liquor from the clams, add one-third as much
water, bring to a slow boil, skim and strain. Then put
in the clams, chopped, with pepper and salt. Stew half
an hour, and stir in two great spoonfuls of butter rolled in
cracker-dust, one teaspoonful essence of celery (Colgate’s),
and the juice of a lemon. Simmer ten minutes, have
ready in your tureen a cup of scalding milk, slightly salted.
Pour upon this the soup, stirring up well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak.</span></h3>

<p>Cook according to receipt given on Thursday of Second
Week in this month. If you use the “Vertical
Broiler,” manufactured by the Dover Stamping Company,
88 North Street, Boston, you will save every drop of gravy,
and be spared the trouble of watching and turning the
steak.—See <span class="smcap">Familiar Talk</span>, “Touching Saucepans.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Tomatoes and Corn.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of corn; drain, and cook twenty minutes
in boiling water, salted. Throw off the water; cover the
bottom of a bake-dish with fine crumbs; put in a layer of
corn, butter, pepper, and salt; upon this a layer of canned
tomatoes; butter and pepper, and sprinkle with a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
sugar. Go on in this order until the dish is full. Cover
with bread-crumbs; stick bits of butter over them, and
bake, covered, half an hour. Brown and serve in the
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Whole Bermuda Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pick out those of uniform size; put on in boiling water,
salted slightly, and cook until a fork will pierce the largest.
Turn off the water; set back on the range to “dry off;”
lay a napkin, heated and neatly folded, upon a dish. Pare
the potatoes quickly by pulling off their skins, and heap
upon the napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Custards.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>Yolks of 5 eggs and the whites of two—reserving three for the <i>méringue</i>.</li>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls bitter almond or vanilla flavoring.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk; beat yolks and two whites light, and
pour the milk upon them. Return to the fire and cook,
stirring all the while, until the custard begins to thicken.
Let it cool. Season and put into glass cups. Whip the
whites to a <i>méringue</i> with a little powdered sugar, and
heap upon the top of each.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ox Head Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 ox head, well cleaned.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>2 grated carrots.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>1 dozen whole allspice, and the same of whole peppers.</li>
<li>1 bunch sweet herbs, chopped.</li>
<li>Browned flour.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful Worcestershire Sauce.</li>
<li>1 glass of sherry.</li>
<li>5 quarts of water.</li>
<li>Small bag of celery seed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the head two hours in cold, salted water. Wash
well, and put on in cold water, with the vegetables and herbs.
Cover, bring slowly to a boil, and cook four hours. Then,
take out the meat of the head; salt well, and set away in
a cool place. Salt and pepper the soup, and set by in
an earthenware crock, leaving in the bones and vegetables.
Do this on Saturday.</p>

<p>On Sunday, take off the fat and heat the soup. Strain,
first through a colander, rubbing the vegetables to a pulp,
then through a sieve, back into the kettle. Cut the meat
into dice and drop in; season with sauce and wine, and
having let it barely boil, pour out.</p>

<p>There should be enough for two days. In setting aside
Monday’s portion, make an equal distribution of meat and
broth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Breast of Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Sew up in a thin cloth and boil ten minutes to the
pound. (Take care of the broth for gravy.) When unwrapped,
lay in a dripping-pan, wash well with butter,
dredge with flour, and set in the oven half an hour, basting
freely with its own broth, and lastly with butter. A few
minutes before taking it up, strew thickly with crumbs—fine
and dry—pepper these, and drop dots of butter over
it. Brown, and dish. Garnish with sliced beet-root and
cresses.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hominy Fritters.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups cold boiled hominy—small-grained.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of cream.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful soda dissolved in vinegar.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the sugar and salt into the hominy; wet with the
milk, and when smooth beat in the whipped eggs. Drop
by the spoonful into boiling fat, and fry quickly. Drain
in a hot colander. Everything depends upon beating and
cooking. The soda should go in last of all the ingredients,
and be whipped in hard.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Browned Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash soft, with butter and milk; mound smoothly
upon a greased plate and brown in a quick oven, glazing
with butter. Slip to a hot flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Pull out the hearts and pick them apart. Heap loosely
in a salad-bowl, and season, first sprinkling lightly with
powdered sugar—with oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Toss
up with a silver fork; lay cold-boiled eggs, cut into sixths,
lengthwise, upon the top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pine-apple Ambrosia.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pine-apple, pared and cut into small squares.</li>
<li>1 cocoanut, pared and grated.</li>
<li>1 cup powdered sugar.</li>
<li>1 large glass good sherry or Marsala.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put a layer of pine-apple in a glass bowl; strew with
sugar, and wet with wine. Next, put a stratum of cocoanut,
and sprinkle more sparsely with sugar. More pine-apple,
sugar, and wine, and continue to add layers in the
order given. The top coating must be of cocoanut. Eat
soon, or the pine-apple will wither in the wine and become
tough. Pass light cake with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Take the fat from the top of the cold soup set by on

drop that is left over.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pilau of Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Cut your cold roast into neat strips an inch long.
Make a gravy of the cracked bones and skin, hard bits,
etc., and a pint of water. While it is stewing down one-half,
skim the liquor in which the meat was parboiled;
put it over the fire with a cup of washed rice, and cook
the latter tender. When there is but one cup of gravy
left upon the bones, etc., strain, season highly with pepper,
salt, and nearly a teaspoonful of curry powder. Chop,
also, a quarter of a pickled onion, and mix in. Roll a
tablespoonful of butter in a heaping spoonful of browned
flour, and when the gravy is hot stir it in; lastly, put in
the mutton, and when nearly on the boil, draw aside.
Drain the rice, and season well. Pile the meat upon a
hot dish, and make a fence of rice about it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of green peas, drain, and cook twenty
minutes in boiling water, a little salt. Strain off the
water; dish the peas, stir in butter, pepper, and if needed,
salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Fondu.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of bread-crumbs, very dry.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>2 cups of fresh milk.</li>
<li>½ lb. of dry cheese, grated.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>A pinch of soda dissolved in boiling water, and stirred into the milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk; beat in the eggs, butter,
seasoning, and at last, the cheese. Butter a bake-dish;
pour in the <i>fondu</i>; cover with crumbs, and bake in a
brisk oven. Serve at once, as it soon falls.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Farina Hasty Pudding with Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of farina.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk, when the farina has soaked two hours
in just enough water to cover it, and has absorbed it all.
Salt the milk and stir in the farina. Boil half an hour,
steadily stirring now and then, from the bottom. Add
the butter; and let the pudding stand in hot water three
minutes after you cease to stir, before turning out into an
open, deep dish. Make a good sauce of butter, sugar,
and nutmeg, and eat with it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Crust Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of dry crusts, the more stale the better, if sweet.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>2 cups of yesterday’s soup.</li>
<li>2 cups of boiling water.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>3 great spoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper.</li>
<li>A little chopped parsley.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pour the boiling water upon the crusts, which should be
broken small. Set in a pot of boiling water for one hour,
with a small onion minced fine, and the seasoning.
Meanwhile skim the cold soup (or any good gravy) and
heat to a boil. At the end of the hour, add the butter to
the bread, and cover ten minutes longer. Then turn
into the soup; beat up the bread and stir in the parsley.
Simmer fifteen minutes, beat the eggs light, pour a little
of the soup upon them to heat them before stirring them
well into the contents of the kettle. Take from the fire
at once, lest the eggs should curdle.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mock Pigeons with Mushroom Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 fillets of veal.</li>
<li>Force-meat of crumbs and chopped salt pork, well seasoned.</li>
<li>½ cup of mushrooms and a little minced onion.</li>
<li>1 sweetbread.</li>
<li>12 oysters.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fillets must be boneless. Sprinkle with pepper
and spread with force-meat. Roll up closely and wind
with packthread. Put into a dripping-pan with enough
water to half cover them. Invert a pan over them, and
bake from forty-five minutes to one hour in proportion to
their size. Boil, then blanch the sweetbread, by dropping
it into cold water. Cut into dice, put into a cup of
oyster liquor with a spoonful of butter, and simmer fifteen
minutes. Baste the “pigeons” four times—twice with butter,
and when tender, lay on a hot dish, clip and carefully
withdraw the threads, and cover to keep warm.
Add the gravy from the dripping-pan to the sweetbread;
thicken with browned flour; boil once; put in the oysters
and mushrooms, chopped, and stew five minutes quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
fast. Pour a few large spoonfuls, taking up the thickest
part, over the “pigeons;” send the rest up in a sauce-boat.
You will find this a very nice dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil and skin while hot. Lay in a pan and anoint
with beef-dripping or butter, from time to time, as they
brown. Drain off the grease and serve hot, after peppering
and salting.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cabbage Sprouts and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Boil the sprouts tender, drain well, pepper and salt.
Lay some slices of crustless toast in a deep dish, and
soak in boiling water; drain them and cover with a soft
omelette made of three or four eggs, “stirred” up in a
pan in which has been heated a spoonful of butter. Lay
the sprouts upon this, butter well and eat hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bread and Raisin Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>1 loaf of stale <i>light</i> bread, pared and sliced.</li>
<li>Butter to spread the bread.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>½ cup of sugar.</li>
<li>¾ lb. of raisins, seeded and cut into thirds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Butter the bread. Make a raw custard of eggs, sugar
and milk. Line the bottom of a buttered dish with the
bread. Wet with custard; strew with raisins, and lay
in more bread. Go on in this order until the dish is full.
The uppermost layer should be of bread, well buttered
and soaked. Cover the dish; set in boiling water, and
bake one hour, keeping the water at a fast boil. Turn
out carefully, and pour hot, sweet sauce over it. The
liquor from brandied peaches, made hot, with a little butter,
makes a delicious sauce for it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

Bouillon of Beef.<br />
Tomato Omelette with Cheese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Savory Rice Pudding.<br />
——<br />
Corn-Starch Custard Pie.<br />
——<br />
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bouillon of Beef.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 lbs. of brisket or round of beef, all in one piece.</li>
<li>4 turnips.</li>
<li>3 carrots.</li>
<li>2 Bermuda onions.</li>
<li>A good handful of cabbage sprouts.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter, cut up in flour.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of made mustard.</li>
<li>4 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cover the beef with the water and cook slowly one
hour. Meanwhile, cut the vegetables into long strips—not
too thin—leaving the sprouts whole. Cook them all
in boiling, salted water twenty minutes. Throw this
water away, and at the end of the hour, skim the soup
well, and put in the vegetables. Stew all very slowly two
hours longer. There must never be a fast boil. Take
out the beef; put into a dripping-pan; pour a cup of the
soup (strained), seasoned well with pepper, salt, and mustard,
over it; dredge thickly with flour and brown in a
good oven, basting every few minutes. Take half the
vegetables from the pot and keep hot. Rub the rest
through a colander; season the soup and pulp, add the
herbs and return to the saucepan; boil sharply five minutes;
stir in butter and flour; simmer five minutes, and
the soup is ready for the tureen. Season the reserved
vegetables, and having dished your beef, lay them, very
hot, around it. Serve with each slice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Omelette with Cheese.</span></h3>

<p>Break six eggs into a bowl and give about a dozen
whirls of the beater, just enough to mingle whites and
yolks well. Have ready in a frying-pan a great spoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of butter. When it begins to hiss, run it quickly over the
bottom of the pan, and pour in your eggs. Take the
handle of the pan in one hand, a cake-turner in the other,
and with the latter, loosen all around the edges of the
omelette, while with the other hand you shake the pan to
keep the eggs free from the bottom. In about three minutes,
the eggs should be “set,” but still soft. Let an assistant
lay upon one-half of the omelette five or six slices
of canned tomatoes. Fold the other half over this by a
dexterous motion of the turner; invert a hot dish upon
the pan; upset the latter, and dish the omelette. Have
at hand a handful of <i>dry</i> cheese, grated and seasoned with
pepper and salt. Strew the omelette thickly, singe with
a red-hot shovel held very close to the cheese, and serve
hot.</p>

<p>N. B.—Teach your cook the art of omelette-making at
breakfasts, and she will soon be capable of managing this
very delightful <i>entrée</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Savory Rice Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 teacupful of raw rice.</li>
<li>1 small onion.</li>
<li>1 cup of weak broth. Steal from your soup before the vegetables go in, if you have no other.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>1 egg.</li>
<li>Nearly a cupful of chopped cold meat—left from yesterday.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the rice with the whole onion in the broth, adding
more, or hot water, as it swells. When the rice is soft
and has soaked up the broth, remove the onion and add a
raw custard made of the milk, egg, pepper, and salt. Mix
well with the meat, put into a greased mould, set in a pan
of boiling water, and bake, covered, until firm. Keep the
water boiling hard. About forty-five minutes should be
ample time. Turn out and eat with meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Starch Custard Pie.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>3 pints of milk.</li>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls of white sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls essence bitter almonds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the milk, stir in the corn-starch wet with milk.
Boil one minute and cool. When cold, beat in the sugar,
the yolks and <i>two</i> whites. Flavor, and bake in open
shells of paste. When the custard is “set,” draw to the
door of the oven, and cover with a <i>méringue</i> made of the
reserved whites whipped stiff with two tablespoonfuls of
white sugar and a teaspoonful of vanilla. Do this quickly
and close the oven until the whites begin to color. Eat
cold.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Frugal Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of bones.</li>
<li>½ lb. of liver.</li>
<li>1 slice of corned ham.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>Nearly a can of tomatoes.</li>
<li>½ cup of sago.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>Sweet herbs.</li>
<li>3 quarts cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Break the bones, chop the meat, vegetables, and herbs,
and cook slowly three hours in the water. Soak the sago,
all this time, in a little cold water. Strain the soup, rubbing
the vegetables and liver through the colander; season,
boil, and skim; put in the sago and cook half an hour
more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Liver à l’Anglaise.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. liver—sliced.</li>
<li>½ lb. fat salt pork.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>1 small onion, minced fine.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful chopped parsley.</li>
<li>Pepper and browned flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Melt, but not heat the butter in a saucepan; lay in the
liver, then the pork, next the minced parsley and onion,
with a little salt and pepper. Cover closely, and set
where it will heat very slowly <i>without boiling</i>, for one
hour and a half. Then increase the heat gradually until
the gravy begins to bubble. Remove from the fire; cover
the liver in a hot water dish, thicken the gravy in the
saucepan and pour over it when it has boiled one minute.
Please obey these directions implicitly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Croquettes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups cold mashed potato, free from lumps.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful melted butter.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>1 raw egg, beaten alone.</li>
<li>Cracker-crumbs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix soft, as for hominy croquettes, roll in egg and
cracker, and fry in hot lard or dripping. You can make
into long rolls, or round balls. Drain, and serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Pick the leaves from the stems; cook twenty minutes
in plenty of boiling, salted water; drain, chop fine, return
to the fire with butter, a little sugar, pepper, and
salt. Beat until nearly dry, and very smooth; mould in
a hot, oblong pan; turn out and garnish with sliced egg.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoanut Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 large cup bread-crumbs.</li>

<h3><span class="smcap">Onion Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 sliced onions.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter, and twice as much flour.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>2 cups of boiling water.</li>
<li>1 cup of mashed potato.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and fried bread.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful essence of celery.</li>
<li>Soda.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fry the onions in the butter; strain the latter; return
to the frying-pan and stir in the flour gradually, cooking
until it is a light bistre color. Thin with boiling water,
added slowly. Meanwhile, heat the milk, and work by
degrees, into the potato. Then strain through a colander
into a saucepan; add a piece of soda the size of a pea,
and set within a pot of boiling water. Cook ten minutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
season well, put in the flour and butter. Then mince
the onions <i>very</i> fine, and stir in. Let all stand in the hot
water ten minutes; add celery. Flavor and pour upon
the fried bread, cut into dice and put into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmon Croquettes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 can preserved salmon.</li>
<li>2 raw eggs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>Yolks of 2 hard boiled eggs.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful anchovy sauce.</li>
<li>Juice of ½ lemon.</li>
<li>Season with salt, pepper, a little mace and nutmeg.</li>
<li>½ cup crumbs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mince the fish; work in the butter, slightly warmed;
the <i>powdered</i> yolks, the seasoning, raw eggs—finally, the
crumbs. Make into rolls; shape well by rolling in a dish
covered thickly with flour. Fry quickly in sweet lard.
Roll each, when done, for one instant, upon a clean cloth
to take off the grease. Lay a square of treble tissue-paper,
red, green, and white, upon a dish (fringing the
ends), and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Chops—Broiled.</span></h3>

<p>If you have not a “vertical broiler,” lay upon a hot
gridiron—greased—and turn often over a clear fire, until
nicely browned. Butter, salt, and pepper each one as it
is taken from the fire.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Squeezed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Put old potatoes on in cold water, and cook soft. Skin
rapidly, set over the fire for one minute; then, twist a
soft, dry cloth around each one until you feel it crush but
not quite break open. Lay each, as you squeeze it,
within a hot dish, lined with a napkin. When all are in,
turn the four corners of the napkin over the top to keep
in the heat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Parsnip Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, scrape, and mash; take out fibres and hard bits.
Work into four large parsnips one beaten egg, a teaspoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of flour, with pepper and salt. Make into small,
round cakes, roll in flour and fry in good dripping. Drain
well, and serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Almond Blanc-Mange.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>1 oz. Cooper’s gelatine.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of almonds, blanched and pounded, with 1 tablespoonful of rose-water to prevent oiling.</li>
<li>¾ cup of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the gelatine one hour in a cup of the milk. Heat
the rest; add the almond-paste, and stir over the fire
three minutes, then put in the sugar and gelatine, and stir
five minutes more. Strain through thin muslin, pressing
hard. When cool, pour into a wet mould, and set upon
ice, or in cold water to form. Eat with cream and sugar.
It is a good plan to blanch the almonds the day before
they are to be pounded.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Okra and Tomato Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 lbs. of coarse beef.</li>
<li>2 lbs. of mutton bones.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>Two slices of corned ham, or a ham bone, or bones of salt pork.</li>
<li>1 can okra and tomatoes.</li>
<li>6 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>Large bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 lump of white sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Crack the bones into splinters. Cut the meat into
strips and mince the herbs. Put on in the water, and
cook <i>slowly</i>, four hours. Strain off the liquor, and divide
into two portions. Season the meat, bones, etc., highly,
put them back into that portion designed for Sunday, and
set aside in a cold place. Pour the stock for to-day’s soup
back into the pot; season with salt and pepper; boil up,
and skim, and add the okra, tomatoes, and sugar. Simmer
half an hour, boil briskly one minute. Skim and
serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef’s Heart.</span></h3>

<p>Choose a fine, fresh one. Wash well, lay in salt and
water an hour, then wipe dry. Stuff with a force-meat of
crumbs, minced salt pork, pepper, salt, and chopped
parsley with a little onion. Pack this in tightly, sew the
heart up in coarse net, fitted well to it, and stew one hour
and a half in weak broth. (A cupful can be taken from
your soup stock.) At the end of this time, take it out,
undo the cloth, and return the heart to the saucepan with
enough gravy to half cover it. Add to this a tablespoonful
of butter cut up in as much flour; pepper and salt to
taste. Cover closely, and simmer half an hour, turning
the heart as it browns. Dish it; add the juice of half a
lemon to the gravy, boil once, and pour over the heart.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ramakins.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Rounds of lightly toasted bread.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls grated cheese.</li>
<li>2 eggs, beaten light.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful melted butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful anchovy sauce.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of flour, wet with cream.</li>
<li>A little salt and cayenne.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat eggs, butter, and seasoning together; then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
cheese, lastly, the flour. Work all to a cream; spread
thickly upon the bread, and brown lightly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Crème.</span></h3>

<p>Heat a cupful of milk; stir in a heaping tablespoonful
of butter cut up in as much flour. Stir until smooth and
thick; pepper and salt, and add two cupfuls of cold boiled
potatoes, sliced, and a little very finely chopped parsley.
Shake over the fire until the potatoes are hot all through,
and pour into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Open the can an hour before it is needed, and empty
into a bowl. When ready for the beans drain off the
liquor and cook in boiling water twenty-five minutes.
Drain, butter, pepper and salt, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Newark Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>1 large cup fine crumbs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of rice-flour.</li>
<li>½ lb. of raisins cut in two, seeded and dredged with flour.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls vanilla, or other extract. (If possible get your flavoring extracts from <span class="smcap">Colgate &amp; Co., 53 and 55 John Street, New York</span>. They are good from first <i>to last</i>, which is more than I can say for many others.)</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of soda.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the yolks. Add the crumbs soaked in a pint of
the milk. Stir in the rice-flour, wet in cold milk; the reserved
pint of milk; the butter, flavoring, the fruit, and
lastly, the whisked whites. Bake one hour in a well-greased
mould; turn out and eat with hard sauce.</p>

a quart—to the rest of the residuum with more seasoning,
and the remains of your okra and tomato soup.
Stew gently half an hour, and set aside in a cool place for
to-morrow. The growing heat of the weather makes this
a necessary precaution.) Put then the clear stock upon
the fire with a whole onion, and simmer thirty minutes.
Skim well, take out the onion, and stir in two tablespoonfuls
of gelatine previously soaked one hour in cold water,
with a tablespoonful (scant) of Harvey’s sauce. Cook
five minutes and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Lamb.</span></h3>

<p>Lay in the dripping-pan; dash a cupful of boiling water
over it and roast in a good oven, allowing about ten minutes—not
more—to the pound. Baste often and freely,
and after half an hour, cover with a sheet of thick paper.
Five minutes before taking it up, remove this, dredge with
flour, and as this browns, bring to a froth with butter.
Do not send the gravy to table if you use mint sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mint Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 tablespoonfuls green mint, chopped very fine.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful white sugar.</li>
<li>About half a cupful best cider vinegar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put sugar and vinegar into a sauce-boat and stir in the
mint. Let it stand fifteen minutes before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>I have purposely avoided too early an introduction of
green vegetables and other spring dainties, through fear
that the high prices demanded for them might make this
part of my work useless for housekeepers of moderate
means. By the first of May, however, even our Northern
markets should be well supplied at reasonable rates with
many delightful esculents which are, as yet, brought only
from the South.</p>

<p>Shell the peas and wash well in cold water. Cook in
boiling water—salted—for twenty-five minutes. A lump
of sugar will be an addition, and a pleasant one, to market
peas. Drain well, stir in a great lump of butter, and
pepper and salt. Serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus upon Toast.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the stalks of equal length, rejecting the woody portions
and scraping the whiter parts retained. Tie in a
bunch with soft tape, and cook <i>about</i> thirty minutes, if of
fair size. Have ready six or eight slices of crustless
bread, nicely toasted. Dip in the asparagus-liquor, butter
well and lay upon a very hot dish. Drain the asparagus,
untie, and arrange upon the toast, peppering and buttering
to taste.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Eggs.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups mashed potato.</li>
<li>½ cup minced meat.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls hot milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful melted butter.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls gravy.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and dripping.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Work the potato <i>smooth</i> with butter, milk, gravy, and
beaten eggs. Put into a saucepan, and stir over the fire
until smoking hot. Stir in the meat; let it get cool
enough to handle. Flour your hands and make the mixture
into egg-shaped balls. Roll in flour and fry in hot
dripping. Pile upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice and Tapioca Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ cup rice.</li>
<li>½ cup tapioca.</li>
<li>¾ cup sugar.</li>
<li>3 pints of milk.</li>
<li>Cinnamon to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the tapioca three hours in half of the milk. Wash
the rice in three waters and soak in the rest of the milk
the same length of time. Put them together, stir in the
sugar by degrees, until all is melted; season with cinnamon
and a pinch of salt; mix up well, and bake in a slow
oven two hours. Make it on Saturday, and eat cold on
Sunday with sugar and cream.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Yesterday’s Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Strain the stock heated up on Sunday with the remains
of Saturday’s soup. Boil four tablespoonfuls of rice in a
little water until soft. Add, with the water, to the soup,
with additional seasoning, if necessary, and heat almost to
a boil. If it has been kept in a cool place you will find it
very good. Never throw away a spoonful of any soup.
It will come into use if you can keep it from spoiling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Lamb.</span></h3>

<p>Trim neatly, garnish with curled parsley, and pass mixed
pickles with it. Few methods of preparing lamb for the
table by warming over can compare with the easier way
of setting it on cold, if it has been nicely roasted at first.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Savory Macaroni.</span></h3>

<p>To a cup of yesterday’s soup add another of boiling
water. Let them boil once; skim and put in half a pound
of macaroni broken into inch lengths. While it is cooking
tender, boil one sweetbread fifteen minutes; throw
into cold water and let it cool, then cut into small dice.
When the macaroni is tender, but not broken, mix with
it a custard made of two eggs, one large cup of milk, and
a little salt. Stir into the macaroni a very little minced
onion, pepper to taste; add the chopped sweetbread;
put into a greased mould, with a cover; put this into a
dripping-pan full of boiling water and cook in a good oven
a little over one hour. Turn out upon a hot dish, and
send around grated cheese with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sea-Kale.</span></h3>

<p>Pick over carefully, tie up in bunches, and lay for half
an hour in cold water. Put into salted boiling water and
cook twenty-five minutes. Put buttered toast in the
bottom of a deep dish; clip the threads binding the kale,
and lay it upon the toast. Pepper, and pour a cupful of
drawn butter over it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Slice cold boiled potatoes, and put a layer in a salad
dish. Cover with thin slices of hard boiled egg, and strew
with bits of pickled onion. When the dish is full pour
over them a dressing made in the proportion of one tablespoonful
of vinegar to three of salad oil; one spoonful of
salt to half as much pepper, and the same quantity of made
mustard. Beat up well before pouring over the salad.
Let all stand ten minutes—or more—before serving.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee and Sister Mag’s Cake.</span></h3>

<p>Let your coffee be strong and hot, with plenty of boiling
milk.</p>

<p>For receipt for the delightful cake mentioned please
see “<span class="smcap">Common Sense in the Household</span>” Series No. 1,
“General Receipts,” page 321. Friday is a good cake-baking
day.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Veal and Tapioca Broth.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. scrag of veal, well broken, and the meat cut small.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>1 turnip.</li>
<li>½ cup of pearl tapioca.</li>
<li>2 blades of mace.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls essence of celery.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>3 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put meat, bones, and sliced vegetables on in the water,
and cook slowly three hours. Soak the tapioca during
this time in a very little milk. Strain the soup, rubbing
the vegetables through the colander; cool to throw up
the fat. Skim and season. When hot again put in the
tapioca and stir until it melts. Simmer half an hour,
add the celery essence and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Beefsteak.</span></h3>

<p>Take the bone from a large sirloin steak; flatten it
with the side of a hatchet, wash over the upper side with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
a beaten egg and spread thickly with a force-meat of
crumbs, minced ham, and any other cold meat you may
have, a teaspoonful of minced onion, a pinch of grated
lemon peel, with pepper and salt, a beaten egg and three
tablespoonfuls of cream or milk. Work these into a
paste before spreading. Roll the steak upon them, binding
closely with soft pack-thread. Have ready some dripping
in a frying-pan, and cook the steak five minutes in
this, turning as it browns. Now lay it in a dripping-pan
with a cupful of boiling water; cover and bake forty minutes,
basting and turning often. When done, remove
the strings; lay the beef upon a hot dish; thicken the
gravy with browned flour, boil up and pour half over it—the
rest into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Young Onions Stewed.</span></h3>

<p>Skin, wash well, and cook in boiling water, salted, until
half-done—say fifteen minutes. Then, throw off nearly
all the water and replenish with scalding milk. Cook
tender in this, stir in pepper, salt, a great spoonful of
butter cut up in a teaspoonful of flour. Simmer three
minutes, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes Baked with Steak.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil, skin, and quarter some large potatoes. About
ten minutes before you take up your steak, lay the potatoes
around it in the pan, and brown in the hot gravy.
Serve in the dish with the meat, laid on the outer edge.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Pull out the hearts and blanched leaves, heap them
within a salad bowl; strew with powdered sugar, and
pour over them a dressing made according to directions
given yesterday. Toss up well with a silver fork.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oatmeal Pudding with Cream.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of boiling milk.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls best Irish oatmeal.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Wet up flour, oatmeal, and salt, with cold milk and stir
into the hot, which must be in a farina-kettle. Stir twenty
minutes well from the bottom, and let it stand ten minutes
in the boiling water without cooking before pouring
into an uncovered deep dish. Eat with cream and sugar.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hot Pot.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 lbs. coarse lean beef, cut up small.</li>
<li>2 good-sized crabs.</li>
<li>½ lb. of streaked salt pork.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>1 bunch of asparagus—the green tops only.</li>
<li>8 Boston crackers.</li>
<li>Cayenne pepper.</li>
<li>Butter for crackers.</li>
<li>6 quarts of water.</li>
<li>Juice of 1 lemon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil beef, herbs and onion together in the water—cooking
slowly—three hours. Cool, to throw up the fat, and
skim well. Put away half of the liquor with the meat,
well-seasoned, for another day. Strain the remainder
back into the pot; add the meat of two boiled crabs
nicely cut—not chopped—up, and the pork, also boiled
and cut into dice; the asparagus-tops, with plenty of seasoning.
Stew for half an hour, gently. Have ready in
your tureen eight Boston crackers split, laid for five minutes
in boiling water, then drained and buttered. Pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the soup over these, cover, and serve, having added the
lemon-juice at the last. Send sliced lemon around with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Breast of Veal with Mushroom Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Trim neatly; take out the largest bone, and fill the
cavity with a good force-meat. Skewer into a compact
shape. Lay in a frying-pan with three tablespoonfuls of
butter, and brown on both sides. Line the bottom of a
large saucepan with slices of pork, pepper them, and lay
in the veal. Cover <i>tightly</i>, and heat very slowly, one
hour, without opening the pot. Then turn the meat,
add half a can of chopped mushrooms, and half a Bermuda
onion, sliced, with a cup of boiling water. Cover
again, and cook for another hour—never fast. The meat
should be cooked almost wholly in its own steam. Turn
again, and simmer fifteen minutes. Take up the meat,
thicken the gravy with browned flour, wet with cold water,
adding a little boiling water, if needful; boil up, and pour
over the veal. If these directions be exactly followed, this
dish will be excellent.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach à la Reine.</span></h3>

<p>Wash well, pick off the leaves, and cook them twenty
minutes in salted, boiling water. Drain and press out
all the water; chop very fine. Return to the saucepan
with a good lump of butter, pepper, salt, a pinch of mace,
a teaspoonful of sugar, and three spoonfuls—large ones—of
good gravy. Stir, beat, and toss, until nearly dry.
Fill hot, wet egg-cups with the mixture, and turn out
upon a heated, flat dish. Lay a slice of egg upon each.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rhubarb (or Pie-plant) Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Skin, and cut up the stalks. Put into a saucepan, with
just enough water to keep them from burning, and stew
slowly until soft. Sweeten while hot, but not on the
fire. Eat cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Browned Potatoes—Mashed.</span></h3>

<p>Whip up boiled potatoes very light with a fork; beat in
butter, milk, and salt. Heat roughly upon a neat bake-dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
(one with a silver stand for the table, if you have it),
and brown in a quick oven, glazing with butter, when
done.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Burnt Custard.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>Nutmeg and flavoring extract to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scald the milk, but not to boiling; beat eggs light with
the sugar, and pour upon them the hot milk. Mix well,
and bake in a well-buttered dish. Turn out when cold;
strew very thickly with white sugar. Set the plate containing
the custard upon the upper grating of a hot oven.
The sugar will melt, and run in brown streams all over
the moulded pudding. Slip carefully to a dish, and eat
cold.</p>

Italian Minestra Soup.<br />
Chicken Pudding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boiled Potatoes.<br />

German Puffs.<br />
——<br />
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Italian Minestra Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Strain the stock reserved for to-day from the bones,
after taking the fat from the top. Never neglect this.
Greasy soups are not good, and plenty of dripping may
be thus obtained for kitchen use. Heat the soup, season
to taste, and add a little more than half a cupful of <i>minestra</i>,
by some known as Italian Paste. It can be had at
the best grocers in various shapes—like wheat-grains, in
small squares, or in stars, circles, letters, etc. Simmer
twenty minutes, and pour out. The <i>minestra</i> should be
tender, but not broken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Cut up a tender fowl into neat joints, and parboil, seasoning
well, ten minutes before you take it up, with pepper,
salt, and a generous spoonful of butter. It should
cook slowly for half an hour. Take up and cool, setting
aside the liquor for your gravy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Batter for the Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>3 cups of prepared flour, not heaping.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of melted butter.</li>
<li>4 well-whipped eggs.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make a hole in the flour, when you have sifted the salt
through it. Mix eggs, milk, and butter together, and
pour in by degrees, beating all up hard at the last. Put
a layer of chicken in the bottom of a bake-dish; pour a
cupful of batter upon it; then more chicken, and so on,
until the dish is full, with batter for the upper crust. It
will require about one hour to bake in a moderate oven.
Skim the cooled gravy, and boil down one-half. Then,
stir in a tablespoonful of butter, cut up in flour. Boil
once, and pour over a beaten egg. Season with chopped
parsley; return to the fire; let it almost boil, and serve
in a sauce-boat. Pass with the pudding.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Put on in cold water, and bring to a rapid boil. When
nearly done, pour off all but a cupful of water. Cover
closely, return to the fire, and steam until the skins crack,
and the potatoes are soft. They will need about half an
hour’s boiling in all. Uncover, strew with salt, leave for
a few moments for the moisture to evaporate, and serve at
once. Old potatoes, treated thus, can be made mealy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Cut about two dozen stalks of asparagus—leaving out
the hard parts—into inch lengths, and boil tender.
Drain; pour upon them a cupful of drawn butter; stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
until hot, then turn into a bake-dish. Break six eggs
upon the top; put a bit of butter upon each; salt and
pepper, and put into a quick oven until the eggs are
“set.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">German Puffs.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 cups of prepared flour.</li>
<li>3 cups of milk.</li>
<li>3 eggs—whites and yolks whipped separately, and very light.</li>
<li>3 teaspoonfuls of melted butter.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make a batter as directed for your chicken pudding,
beat up hard, and bake in nine cups, such as you used
for measuring, to a fine brown. The oven should be a
quick one, and the puffs be served immediately in their
cups.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Corn Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 can of sweet corn.</li>
<li>1 quart of boiling water.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of butter rolled in one tablespoonful of flour.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful tomato catsup.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>Drain the corn and chop it in a chopping-tray. Put on
in the boiling water and cook steadily one hour. Rub
through a colander, leaving the husks behind and return,
with the water in which it has boiled, to the fire. Season;
boil gently three minutes and stir in the butter and flour.
Have ready the boiling milk, pour it upon the beaten
eggs, and these into the soup. Simmer one minute, stirring
all the while; take up, add the catsup and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Shad.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash and wipe a large roe shad. Set aside the
roes for your scallop. Sew up the fish in a thin cloth
fitted to its shape; cover well with boiling salted water,
and cook from forty-five minutes to an hour, according to
its size. Unwrap and butter and pepper, after laying it
upon a hot dish. Pour over it a few spoonfuls of drawn
butter in which have been mixed the chopped yolks of
two eggs, a little parsley, and the juice of a lemon. Serve
the same in a boat. Garnish the fish with rings of the
whites of the boiled eggs, with a sprig of parsley in each.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Roes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>The roes of the shad.</li>
<li>1 cup of drawn butter, and the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of anchovy paste.</li>
<li>Juice of half a lemon.</li>
<li>1 cup of bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>Parsley, salt and pepper to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the roes in water with a little vinegar stirred in.
Lay in cold water five minutes and wipe dry. Break up
with the back of a spoon, but do not crush the eggs. Set
by, and pound the boiled yolks to a powder. Beat this
into the drawn butter, then the parsley and other seasoning,
finally the roes. Strew the bottom of a bake-dish
with crumbs; pour in the mixture, and cover thickly with
fine crumbs. Stick dots of butter over the top, and bake,
covered, until it begins to bubble, then brown upon the
upper grating of the oven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Snow.</span></h3>

<p>Mash with a beetle very fine, working in salt only.
Then rub hard and fast through a colander into a hot dish.
The potato should fall in light spiral threads. Set in the
oven three minutes to renew the heat, but do not let it
“crust” or brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>See receipt given on Sunday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cress Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Pull the sprigs to pieces and pour over them a dressing
such as was made for your potato salad on Monday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Trifle.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Juice of 2 lemons and grated peel of one.</li>
<li>1 pint cream, well sweetened and whipped stiff.</li>
<li>1 cup of sherry.</li>
<li>A little nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let sugar, lemon-juice, and peel lie together two hours
before you add wine and nutmeg. Strain through double
tarlatan, and whip gradually into the frothed cream.
Serve very soon, heaped in small glasses. Pass cake with
this as well as with the tea.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tea and Cake.</span></h3>

<p>Whereas pound, jelly, or cup-cake should accompany
your trifle, small sponge-cakes, or cookies—not too sweet—taste
better with tea, and do not detract so much from
its flavor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Minced Beef Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 lbs. lean beef, minced fine, as for beef-tea.</li>
<li>2 lbs. mutton-bones.</li>
<li>2 carrots, grated.</li>
<li>2 sliced onions.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs, and small bunch of asparagus, also chopped.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>5 quarts of water.</li>
<li>Strips of buttered toast.</li>
</ul>

<p>Crack the bones to splinters, and put on with the vegetables
in three quarts of cold water and boil two hours.
Strain, rubbing the vegetables to a pulp, and add, with the
rest of the water, also cold, to the minced beef. Bring to
a boil, cook gently one hour after it boils, and strain,
pressing hard. Reserve a little of the beef for force-meat,
and put away the rest well seasoned, after pouring back
over it half the soup, as stock for to-morrow. Keep in a
cool place. Chop the herbs and put into that meant for
to-day, with pepper and salt. Boil and skim fifteen minutes.
Have ready some long strips of buttered crisp
toast in the tureen and pour on the soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ragoût of Mutton.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of mutton, without bone, cut into strips three inches long by one wide.</li>
<li>2 lamb sweetbreads.</li>
<li>1 cup of gravy made from bones, skin, etc.—the “trimmings” of the meat.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>2 eggs.</li>
<li>¼ lb. streaked salt pork.</li>
<li>1 fried onion.</li>
<li>1 cup of green peas.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and parsley.</li>
<li>Dripping for frying.</li>
<li>Browned flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fry the onion in plenty of dripping; then the meat for
five minutes. Parboil the sweetbreads, throw into cold
water to blanch; wipe and slice; then fry also in the fat.
Lay sliced pork in the bottom of a saucepan, upon this
the mutton, then the sweetbreads, next the onion, the
green peas, then pepper and salt. Cover with the gravy;
put on a close lid and stew gently for an hour after the
boil sets in. Take up the meat and sweetbreads; thicken
the gravy with browned flour; pour it upon two beaten
eggs, stir one minute over the fire and pour upon the
meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Cut cold boiled potatoes lengthwise; cook over a clear
fire upon a greased gridiron, until they begin to brown.
Lay upon a hot dish, butter, pepper, and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">French Beans with Force-meat Balls.</span></h3>

<p>Chop the beef taken from the soup when cold. Add
one-third as much bread-crumbs, and season well. Put
a spoonful of butter into a saucepan, and when it hisses,
stir in the meat, then a little browned flour wet up with
cold water. Beat an egg light, pour the meat upon it,
and mix well. Make into floured balls and fry in hot dripping.
Cook the beans as usual and lay the balls about
them when dished.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Rice.</span></h3>

<p>Wash well and cook in hot salted water, shaking up
from time to time until the water is nearly all absorbed,
and the rice soft, with every grain distinct. Put a good
piece of butter upon the top after it is dished.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Neapolitan Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 large cup of bread-crumbs soaked in milk.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>¾ cup of sugar.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>1 lemon, juice and grated rind.</li>
<li>½ lb. stale sponge-cake.</li>
<li>½ lb. almond maccaroons.</li>
<li>½ cup jelly or jam.</li>
<li>1 small tumbler of sherry wine.</li>
<li>½ cup of milk for the crumbs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful melted butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream butter and sugar. Beat in the whipped yolks;
then the crumbs, the lemon, and when this is a smooth
paste, the whites. Butter a mould thickly, and cover the
bottom with dry bread-crumbs, and these with maccaroons,
laid evenly. Wet with wine, and pour on a layer
of the mixture just made; next, put sliced cake spread
with jelly, then more maccaroons wet with wine, more
custard, cake and jam, until all the materials are used up,
with a layer of custard on top. Cover closely; set in a
pan of boiling water and cook three-quarters of an
hour in the oven, then remove the top and brown. Turn
out carefully, and pour over it a sauce made of currant-jelly
warmed, and beaten up with two tablespoonfuls of
melted butter and a glass of wine. A plain round mould
is best for this pudding.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Soup à l’Italienne.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the top of the reserved stock, strain
it and heat to scalding. Heat in another vessel a pint of
milk, pour it upon three beaten eggs; return to the
saucepan with a little salt and a pinch of soda, and cook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
two minutes, stirring all the while. Have ready four
tablespoonfuls of grated cheese in the bottom of a tureen,
pour in, first, the milk and eggs, then the soup. Stir all
up well, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef à la Mode.</span></h3>

<p>Remove the bone from a round of beef, and trim away
the gristle and tough bits from the edges. (Cover these
with water and boil down for soup-stock. Season highly
and put by in a cool place for Monday.) Bind the beef
into a good shape by sewing about it a broad band of
stout muslin, as wide as the round is high. Cut a pound
of salt pork into strips long enough to reach from
top to bottom of the beef—make incisions in it with a
thin, long-bladed knife, and thrust these in closely
together. Fill the hole from which the bone was taken
with a force-meat of minced pork and crumbs, highly
spiced. Put the meat thus prepared in a deep earthenware
dish, and rub well into it a mixture of one cup of
vinegar, a teaspoonful of mixed cloves and allspice, a teaspoonful
of salt, and the same of made mustard; a tablespoonful
of sugar and a bunch of sweet herbs minced, with
as much pepper as salt. Leave the beef in the pan with
the spiced vinegar about the base from Saturday until
Sunday morning, turning several times. Early on Sunday,
put it into a large pot, with enough boiling water to
half-cover it; cover tightly with a weight upon the lid, and
stew at least four hours—or half an hour for each pound.
Open once, when half-done, to turn the meat. Dish the
meat; cut the stitches in the band, and withdraw it carefully.
Keep hot while you prepare the gravy. Pour off
all but a cupful, and set aside for soup-stock. Thicken
that reserved with browned flour, and serve in a boat.
Cut the beef in horizontal slices.</p>

<p>When dinner is over, pin another band tightly about the
meat; pour gravy on the top, and set a plate with a heavy
weight upon it, on the round, before putting it away for
Monday’s dinner.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus upon Toast, and Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Please see receipts given on last Sunday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash in the usual manner, working in milk, butter, and
salt. Make into a smooth mound in a deep dish, and score
deeply on top with the back of a knife.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tropical Snow.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>10 sweet oranges.</li>
<li>1 cocoanut, pared and grated.</li>
<li>2 glasses sherry.</li>
<li>1 cup powdered sugar.</li>
<li>6 bananas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Peel and cut the oranges small, taking out the seeds.
Put a layer in a glass-bowl and wet with wine, then strew
with sugar. Next, put a layer of grated cocoanut, slice
the bananas thin, and cover the cocoanut with them.
When the dish has been filled in this order, heap with cocoanut.
Eat soon, or the oranges will toughen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jelly Cake,</span></h3>

<p>In some of its pretty variations, and sliced in triangles,
should go around with the snow.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from both portions of stock set by for to-day;
put them together, and strain into a soup-kettle.
Heat to a boil, skim well, and after fifteen minutes’ cooking,
add a quarter of a pound of macaroni, boiled tender
in salted hot water, and cut into pieces about an inch
long. Simmer ten minutes and pour out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pressed Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Take the weight from your round of beef; undo the
bandage, and set on the table cold, garnished with cresses.
Cut in thin horizontal slices. It will be handsomely
mottled with the pork. Many prefer to eat à la mode
beef cold, always.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach.</span></h3>

<p>Cook as directed upon last Wednesday, but leaving out
the gravy and not drying out so much. Beat to a smooth
cream, and turn into a deep dish, with sippets of fried
bread at the base.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Puff.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cupfuls of cold mashed potatoes.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>½ cup of milk.</li>

<li>Pinch of cinnamon and the same of mace.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the rice in the milk for two hours in a farina-kettle,
surrounded by warm water. Then increase the
heat, and simmer until the rice is tender. Cream butter
and sugar, and whisk into the eggs, until very light.
When the rice is almost cold, stir all together, and bake in
a buttered dish three-quarters of an hour. Eat warm with
sauce, or cold with sugar and cream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Green Pea Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. lean beef.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
<li>½ peck of green peas.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of rice-flour.</li>
<li>Chopped parsley.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the empty pea-pods in the water one hour. Strain
these out, put in the beef, cut up fine, and cook gently
one hour and a half longer, or until the beef is in rags.
Add the peas; boil half an hour, and rub hard through a
colander to pulp the peas. Return to the fire, season, and
stir in the rice-flour wet up in cold water, and the parsley.
Stir ten minutes, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breaded Mutton Chops.</span></h3>

<p>Trim neatly, cutting off all the fat and skin. Roll in
beaten egg, then in cracker-crumbs, and fry in hot dripping,
turning as the under-side browns. Drain well and
serve, standing upon the thick part around the base of
your potatoes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>After mashing soft and smooth with butter, milk, and
salt, mound upon a flat, hot dish, with the chops laid up
against them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Empty a can of tomatoes an hour before you mean to
use them, and leave in a crockery bowl. Put on in a
saucepan, and stew twenty minutes; add salt, pepper, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
little sugar, and a good spoonful of butter, and simmer
ten minutes more.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce.</span></h3>

<p>Cut up—not chop—and pour over them a dressing made
of—</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of salad-oil.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>5 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful white sugar.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of made mustard.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful pepper.</li>
<li>Yolks of 2 boiled eggs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the eggs to a powder, add all the ingredients
except the vinegar, and let alone five or ten minutes.
Then beat in the vinegar with your “Dover” egg-whisk
until the mixture is smooth. Garnish with a chain of the
whites.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Batter Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>4 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
<li>2 even cups of prepared flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat up the eggs, and add the yolks to the milk. Salt
the flour, and stir in alternately with the whites. Beat

<h3><span class="smcap">Fine White Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>3 lbs. veal knuckle, cracked to pieces.</li>
<li>1 old chicken, cut up as for fricassee.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of almonds blanched some hours before you use them, and when quite dry and brittle, pounded to a paste.</li>
<li>Lump of white sugar.</li>
<li>1 pint of milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter, cut up in two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful essence of celery.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>5 quarts cold water.</li>
<li>Soda.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat from the knuckle; put this, the chicken,
bones and onion, with the water, and boil slowly two
hours. Take out the chicken, and put into a deep jar or
bowl, sprinkling well with salt. Cook the soup an hour
longer; strain back into the pot, pressing the meat hard.
Take out half of the liquid, season well, and pour upon
the chicken, cover, and set in a cold place for to-morrow’s
“stock.” Season the soup in the kettle with pepper and
salt. Boil and skim. Chop the veal-shreds very fine, and
mix with the almonds. Have ready the milk, scalding
hot, with a pinch of soda stirred in, and pour upon the
veal-and-almond paste. Set over the fire in a saucepan,
and stir in the butter and corn-starch, simmering five
minutes. Add the sugar, and turn into the tureen, then
pour in the soup. Stir all up well, and let them stand,
covered, in hot water, a few minutes. Stir up again and
send to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Liver, Larded.</span></h3>

<p>Cut half a pound of fat salt pork into lardoons, and thrust
them, about half an inch apart, into a fresh liver, so that
they will project on both sides. Put two tablespoonfuls
of butter into a saucepan, with a small onion minced,
pepper, and some sweet herbs chopped, also a few spoonfuls
of strained tomato (left over from yesterday). Cover
closely, and set in a frying-pan of boiling water for one
hour, keeping the outer pan full all the time, and turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the liver twice. Then, take out the saucepan, and set
over the fire, but cook <i>slowly</i>. When the liver is nicely
browned below, turn it. At the end of forty minutes, boil
up once sharply—and for the first time. Take out the
liver, and keep hot. Add a little boiling water to the
gravy, strain, thicken with browned flour, and pour over
the liver.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Pea Pancakes.</span></h3>

<p>Two cups of green peas, boiled, and mashed when hot.
Season with butter, pepper, and salt, and when cold, beat
in two eggs, a cupful of milk, half a teaspoonful of soda,
and twice as much cream of tartar, sifted twice through
half a cupful of flour. Beat well, and bake as you would
griddle-cakes. Eat very hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus in Ambush.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>The green tops of two bunches of asparagus.</li>
<li>8 or 9 stale biscuits, or small, light rolls.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>1 great spoonful of butter, rolled in flour.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take out the crumb from the rolls, when you have cut
off the tops to serve as covers, and set them open in the
oven to crisp, laying the tops by them. Heat the milk,
pour upon the beaten eggs; stir over the fire until they
begin to thicken, when add the butter and flour. Lastly,
put in the asparagus, boiled tender, and chopped fine.
Fill the rolls with this mixture, put on the tops, and serve
hot. <i>Good!</i></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bermuda Potatoes</span> <i>en robe de chambre</i>.</h3>

<p>Put on in boiling water, and cook until a fork will pierce
them. Throw off the water and set back, uncovered,
upon the range to dry off, strewing with salt at the same
time, Send to table in a dish lined with a napkin, peeling
as you eat them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pine-Apple Pie.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 large pine-apple, pared and grated.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>½ cup of butter.</li>
<li>5 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>A little nutmeg.</li>
<li>Some good pie-paste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream, butter and sugar. Beat in the yolks for three
minutes; add pine-apple and spice; lastly, the whites.

<h3><span class="smcap">Mulligatawny Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Skim the stock set aside yesterday, and strain from the
chicken into a soup-pot. Add a small onion and half a
cupful of raw rice, and simmer forty minutes, or until the
rice is tender. Wet up a tablespoonful of curry powder
with the juice of a lemon, and stir in then a large spoonful
of butter rolled in flour. Boil once and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Patés.</span></h3>

<p>Chop the meat of your cold chicken fine, and season
well. Make a large cupful of rich drawn butter, and
while it is on the fire, stir in two eggs boiled hard and
minced very fine, also a little chopped parsley—then the
chicken-meat. Let it almost boil. Have ready some
<i>paté</i> pans of good paste, baked quickly to a light brown.
Slip while hot from the pans, fill with the mixture, and set
in the oven to heat. Arrange upon a dish and send up
hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sea-Kale.</span></h3>

<p>Choose fresh, and pick over carefully; cook twenty-five
minutes in boiling, salted water; drain and press well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Chop fine; put back in the saucepan with a great lump
of butter, pepper, salt, and the juice of half a lemon.
Stir and beat, and heap upon slices of buttered crustless
toast laid upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes au Maître d’Hôtel.</span></h3>

<p>Put a cup of milk into a saucepan, and when it heats,
stir in two tablespoonfuls of butter rolled in flour, with
salt, pepper, and chopped parsley; then about two cupfuls
cold boiled potatoes, sliced rather thick. Heat
scalding hot, take from the fire and add a pinch of grated
lemon-peel with the juice of half a lemon. Serve in a
deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce and Cress Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Cut up lettuce and cresses, having washed both well,
and pile in a salad bowl; then pour over them a dressing
made by beating together four tablespoonfuls of vinegar,
one teaspoonful each of salt and sugar, half as much mustard,
and when these are well mixed, adding, gradually,
two tablespoonfuls of best salad oil. Toss with a silver
fork, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Queen of Puddings with Strawberry Méringue.</span></h3>

<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>Lemon flavoring.</li>
<li>1 quart fresh milk.</li>
<li>1 pint fresh strawberries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream the butter, and a cup of sugar. Beat in the
whipped yolks; the crumbs, soaked in the milk; lastly,
the seasoning. Fill a pudding-dish two-thirds full and
bake until the custard is “set.” Draw to the mouth of
the oven, and cover with the strawberries, rolled in sugar,
then with a <i>méringue</i> made of the whipped whites
and the half-cup of sugar. Bake until the <i>méringue</i> begins
to color. Eat cold with cream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>4 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>Dripping for frying.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Slice the vegetables, with the exception of the peas, and
fry them in dripping until brown. Put with the herbs into
a kettle and cover with the water. Cook slowly two
hours, reducing the liquid one-third. Pulp the vegetables
through a colander, return the soup to the fire with the
rice and peas, and stew half an hour. Season, stir in the
butter and flour with the sugar. Simmer five minutes
and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Shad.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and wipe a fine roe-shad. Split it and cut
each side into four or five pieces, leaving out the head and
tail, and cutting off the fins: Sprinkle with salt and pepper;
roll in flour and fry to a fine brown in plenty of lard
or dripping, turning as each piece browns. Drain well,
and serve hot. Garnish with sliced cucumber, pickle and
parsley, and pass sliced lemon with it. Send around
mashed potatoes with this dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

rolled cracker, and fry to a nice brown. Drain in a
heated colander, and pile upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Proceed with this oft-repeated and ever-welcome dish as
I have directed upon other pages.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes with Onion and Bread.</span></h3>

<p>Empty a can of tomatoes into a saucepan, and when
hot, add a small onion, sliced, with pepper, salt, and a

in a dripping-pan of boiling water. Bake until “set,”
cover with a <i>méringue</i> made of the whisked whites
(reserved) and a little powdered sugar. Bake until they
begin to be tinged. Eat cold from the cups.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sweetbread Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 lbs. of lean, coarse veal.</li>
<li>½ lb. corned ham.</li>
<li>2 lbs. beef bones.</li>
<li>2 fine sweetbreads.</li>
<li>Bunch of parsley.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of tapioca, soaked in cold water one hour.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>5 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat into strips; crack the bones; mince the
onion and parsley, and put on with the water. Cook
slowly four hours. Strain; set aside some bits of
“ragged” veal and ham for your dish of rice. Put the
rest into a crock; season highly and pour on half your
soup stock—setting this by, as usual, in a cool place for
Sunday. Season the remainder of the broth; boil and
skim; put in the sweetbreads, and cook half an hour.
Take them out and drop into cold water. Add the
tapioca to the soup; simmer ten minutes; chop the
sweetbreads, and put them back; boil one minute and
serve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteaks.</span></h3>

<p>Flatten your steaks with the side of an axe or hatchet,
taking out the bones for your soup. Butter a gridiron—if
you have no “broiler”—and cook the steaks quickly
over a bright fire, turning often as they drip. Lay upon
a hot dish; butter abundantly and season. Cover with
another heated platter, and let them stand five minutes
before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Rice.</span></h3>

<p>Wash a cup of rice well. Take a cupful of broth from
your soup-pot; strain through a thin cloth, and add twice
as much boiling water, with a little salt. Put in the rice
and cook slowly until it has taken up all the water and is
soft. Pour in a large cup of hot milk in which have been
mixed two eggs (raw), two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese,
and a tablespoonful of butter. Stir up well; add about
half a cupful of minced veal and ham, taken from your
soup; turn into a greased mould; cover and bake one
hour in a dripping-pan of hot water. Dip in cold water,
and invert upon a flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>See receipts for last Sunday week.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Roast in a moderate oven until soft. Cut a piece
<i>nearly</i> off the top of each; thrust a thin-bladed knife into
the heart, and slip in a bit of butter. Replace the skin
and send up hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Omelette aux Confitures.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>7 eggs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>½ cup of milk (or cream).</li>
<li>Grated peel of ½ lemon.</li>
<li>½ cup of marmalade or jam.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat yolks and whites apart and very stiff. Add sugar,
lemon, and milk to the yolks; then, with a few rapid whirls
of your “beater,” the whites. Put the marmalade in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
bottom of a neat bake-dish (buttered), pour on the omelette,
and bake until it has puffed up high and begins to “crust”
well. Serve at once, or it will fall. Eight minutes should
suffice to cook it—at the outside.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tea and Albert Biscuits</span></h3>

<p>May be partaken of at the same time with the omelette,
or afterwards.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sago Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>The stock made on yesterday.</li>
<li>Little more than ½ cup of pearl sago.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take the fat from your cold stock; pour off carefully
from the sediment and strain. Heat to boiling. Wash
the sago well; soak in warm water half an hour; put into
the soup, and simmer twenty-five minutes. Meanwhile,
heat the milk in another vessel, and pour upon the eggs.
Heat this until it begins to thicken, pour into the tureen,
season with a little salt and pepper, and turn in the boiling
soup. It should be about as thick as hot custard
when all the ingredients are in.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Shoulder of Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Get your butcher to take out the bone. (It will help
out to-morrow’s soup.) Fill the hole from which it was
taken with a good force-meat of crumbs, minced pork,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
sweet herbs, pepper, salt, and one raw egg. Sew up the
edges of the skin to keep in the stuffing, and roast about
fifteen minutes—not more—for each pound, basting often,
at first with the boiling water you have poured upon it,
at the last twice with butter. When done, brush with
beaten egg; sift crumbs all over it; put into a stout
stone-ware dish—or one of block-tin—surround with the
potato-edging, and brown in a quick oven. Pour off the
fat from the gravy, strain, thicken with browned flour, and
serve in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Edging.</span></h3>

<p>Mash the potatoes very soft with milk and butter; beat
in two eggs; return to the saucepan and stir until smoking
hot all through. Let them get quite cool; then, mould
by pressing firmly into a wet egg-cup, and turning out
each form upon the mutton-dish. Arrange the little cones
side by side until you have a barricade about the meat.
Set in the oven and brown, glazing with butter just before
you take the dish out. Serve a cone with each slice of
mutton.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Asparagus.</span></h3>

<p>See receipt on first Sunday in May.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Purée of Green Peas.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Take for half a peck of peas—</li>
<li>1 small onion.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of cream.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter cut up in one tablespoonful of flour.</li>
<li>1 lump of white sugar.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the empty pods twenty minutes in hot, salted
water. Strain these out, and put in the peas with the
sugar. Boil gently until they are very soft. Rub through
a fine colander. Add a cupful of the water in which they
were cooked, pepper and salt, and put over the fire.
When very hot, stir in the floured butter, and, when this is
mixed, the cream. Stir three minutes and pour out into
a dish lined with strips of fried bread.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Neapolitan Blanc-Mange.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>1 package Cooper’s gelatine, soaked two hours in a cup of cold water.</li>
<li>¾ of a cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 great spoonful grated chocolate, wet in a little boiling water.</li>
<li>Beaten yolk of an egg.</li>
<li>1 great spoonful currant jelly, or cranberry jam.</li>
<li>Rose-water for flavoring.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk to boiling, stir in the sugar, then the gelatine.
Cook about five minutes, and strain through thin
muslin. Divide the blanc-mange into four equal portions.
Beat the chocolate well into one; heat for one minute, and
put by in a cup or bowl. Do the same with the egg to a
second, and the currant jelly for the third. This last
must be heated carefully, and a little sugar added, that
the milk may not curdle. Leave the fourth white, and
flavor with rose-water. When cold and a little stiff, pour
into a wet mould—the white first; when this is so firm
as to bear the weight of the next without mixing, the
pink; then, the yellow; lastly, the brown. Do this on
Saturday. On Sunday dip the mould in warm water,
work the surface free with your fingers, and turn out upon
a flat dish. Eat with cream and sugar, or brandied fruit.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clam Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Early in the morning crack your mutton-bone, and put
on in a quart of cold water, at the back of the range. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
little more than a large cupful of liquor remains, take it off
and strain into a bowl to cool. When perfectly cold take
off the fat, put in a quart of clam liquor and the hard
parts of fifty clams. Season with a teaspoonful of minced
onion, as much chopped parsley, a pinch of mace, pepper
and salt to taste, and cook, covered, half an hour after
the boil begins. Heat in another vessel two cups of milk;
when hot, stir in two tablespoonfuls of butter, rolled in a
heaping tablespoonful of flour, and set in boiling water to
keep hot, after it has boiled two minutes. Strain the soup
back into the pot, put in the soft parts of the clams—the
only digestible portions—and simmer five minutes. Pour
the thickened milk into the tureen, stir in the soup, and
serve.</p>

<p>This is a delightful and nutritious soup, and since you
are to have cold meat for dinner, you need not grudge
the care of preparing it, even on Job’s birthday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Your stuffed shoulder will be nearly as nice cold as hot.
Garnish it tastefully with curled parsley and bleached lettuce-leaves.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brussels Sprouts.</span></h3>

<p>Cook in boiling, salted water twenty-five minutes;
drain well; add a liberal lump of butter, with pepper and
salt to taste, and put into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Peel with a sharp knife; slice, and lay in a salad-bowl.
Season with a dressing of oil, vinegar, salt and pepper in
the proportions given on last Thursday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil whole until a fork will pierce them. Peel quickly;
crack, without breaking, each, by pressing it, and drop
into a saucepan containing a large cup of milk, almost on
the boil. When all the potatoes are in, add two tablespoonfuls
of butter, with salt and pepper. Cover and
heat—below the boiling point—until the potatoes begin
to crumble. Pour into a deep dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oranges and Bananas.</span></h3>

<p>Serve whole, upon china plates, with a knife for each.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee and Cake.</span></h3>

<p>You need not be ashamed of “cold meat on Monday,”
even should John have “picked up” his unexpected
friend on the street, when your bright coffee-urn, with the
fragrant contents, flanked by a basket of sliced home-made
cake, comes in as a reserved force.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Brown Beef Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of coarse, lean beef, cut into strips.</li>
<li>3 onions—small ones.</li>
<li>3 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful mixed allspice and mace.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs chopped.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful Colgate’s essence of celery.</li>
<li>Glass of brown sherry.</li>
<li>Dripping.</li>
<li>Toasted bread.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fry the sliced onion brown in good dripping; then the
beef, quickly. Put into a soup-pot, cover with the water;
put on a tight lid, and stew four hours. Strain and press
hard. Let the soup cool to throw up the fat. Skim, and
return to the pot, with the salt, pepper, herbs, and spice.
Simmer fifteen minutes; add wine and celery, and pour
into a tureen upon dice of crisp, buttered toast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Cutlets and Ham.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. veal cutlets without bone.</li>
<li>1½ lbs. of ham.</li>
<li>Grated lemon-peel.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 raw, beaten egg.</li>
<li>Rolled cracker.</li>
<li>Dripping or lard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the slices of ham ten minutes; let them get cold,
and cut of the same size and shape as the strips of veal,
viz., about three inches long by one and a half wide.
Salt and pepper the veal; sprinkle each cutlet with a pinch
of lemon-peel; roll in egg, then cracker, and fry to a
good brown. Fry the ham in its own fat in another pan,
and lay upon a hot dish, alternately with the cutlets.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>If fresh, top and tail, and, with a sharp knife, take off
the strings on both sides. Cut into short pieces, and cook
tender in boiling water, and a little salt. Drain well,
heap upon a hot dish; butter freely, and season to taste.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chopped Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Chop cold boiled potatoes rather coarsely. Have
ready a great spoonful of butter in a saucepan, with a
little grated lemon-peel, pepper and salt. Stir in the
potatoes until very hot, but do not let them brown.
Serve in a deep dish, after draining.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce.</span></h3>

<p>Pick out and pull apart the hearts and best blanched
leaves. Pour over it a dressing such as was directed on
last Thursday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Graham Hasty Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>2 even cups of Graham flour.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>Heat half the milk in a <i>greased</i> saucepan or farina-kettle.
Wet the flour with the rest, and beat very light
with the butter—melted—the eggs and salt. Stir this
into the hot milk—or, better still—pour the milk upon it.
When thoroughly mixed, return to the fire, and stir fifteen
minutes, surrounded by boiling water at its highest bubble.
Take from the range, leave in the water five minutes;
stir up again, and serve in a deep, uncovered dish. Eat
with butter, sugar, and nutmeg.</p>

——<br />
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Asparagus Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. knuckle of veal.</li>
<li>½ lb. streaked salt pork.</li>
<li>3 bunches of asparagus.</li>
<li>4 quarts of water.</li>
<li>1 pint of spinach leaves.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 small onion, sliced.</li>
<li>Butter and sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the veal, pork, onion, and the hard parts of the
asparagus-stalks—all cut up fine—on in the water, and
boil gently four hours. Meanwhile cook the spinach
tender in a little water; chop and squeeze it through
double tarlatan back into the cupful of water in which it
was boiled. Add a lump of sugar to the green liquid.
Strain the soup; season, boil once, and skim; put in the
green heads of the asparagus (kept until now in cold
water) and boil slowly twenty minutes. Stir in two tablespoonfuls
of butter, rolled in flour, and when this has boiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
a minute, the green water. Simmer five minutes more,
and pour out. Dip up from the bottom with each ladleful
in helping the soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Chicken.</span></h3>

<p>Cut into joints, leaving none of the pieces large. Put
the scrags, feet (having scalded off the skin), and giblets
into two cupfuls of water, and stew until the meat is in
rags. Put a quarter of a pound of pork, cut as fine as
shavings, in the bottom of a saucepan; lay on this a teaspoonful
of minced onion, and then the uncooked chicken.
Strain, and partly cool the gravy, which should have
boiled down to one cupful—setting by the giblets. Pour
this over the chicken, pepper and salt; put on a tight top,
and cook very slowly one hour. Then increase the heat,
but still do not let it boil hard, for half an hour longer.
Open the saucepan at the end of the first hour to change the
upper pieces to lower places—and again when the half
hour is up, to see if they are all tender. If not, cover and
cook until they are. Take out the chicken, lay in order
upon a hot-water dish, and add to the gravy the giblets,
minced fine, and a tablespoonful of butter rubbed into
one of flour. Boil one minute, and pour upon a half cup
of milk in which have been beaten two eggs. Set over the
fire, and stir one minute, but do not let the gravy boil.
Pour upon the chicken.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>If raw tomatoes are dear still, drain off most of the
liquor from a can of the vegetable. Cover the bottom of
a pie-dish with bread-crumbs, lay in the tomatoes, well
seasoned with butter, pepper, salt, and sugar; cover
thickly with fine, dry crumbs; put dots of butter, with
pepper and salt, over all, and bake, covered, half an hour—then,
brown quickly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>Drain the liquor from a can of corn, and chop the
grains in a chopping-tray. Beat into this paste three
eggs, one cup of milk, a heaping tablespoonful of sugar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
and as much warmed butter, with two tablespoonfuls of
prepared flour. Beat thoroughly, season with pepper and
salt, and fry, by the spoonful, upon a greased griddle.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Marmalade Roll.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart prepared flour—Hecker’s <i>always</i>, when you can get it.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of lard and two of butter.</li>
<li>1 pint of milk, or enough for soft dough.</li>
<li>1 cup of sweet marmalade.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the lard into the flour; wet into a soft paste with
the milk, and roll out very thin. Baste thickly with the
butter, sprinkle with flour lightly, and roll up in close folds.
Lay upon ice, or in a very cold place, one hour. Roll
out into a square sheet, a quarter of an inch thick, spread
with the marmalade, leaving a narrow margin all around,
and roll up neatly. Lay in a buttered baking-pan, the
joined edge downward, and bake three-quarters of an
hour. Wash over with white of egg, beaten with a little
sugar, just before you take it up. Eat hot with a good
sauce.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sheep’s Head Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 sheep’s head, dressed with the skin on.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>Bunch of parsley.</li>
<li>Crumbs and egg for force-meat balls.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>1 tablespoonful of corn-starch.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>Dripping.</li>
<li>4 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will probably have to coax your butcher to dress
the head properly, but the head itself he will be willing to
give you, as almost worthless in his eyes. Be sure it is
quite clean, even to the mouth. Soak it in tepid water,
one hour—then put into a pot with the vegetables, sliced,
the chopped herbs and the cold water. Cook gently four
hours. Strain off the soup, rubbing the vegetables
through the sieve; let it get almost cool, that you may
remove the fat from the top, and put back over the fire
with pepper and salt. Chop the brains and mix them
into a paste with an equal quantity of crumbs; also
pepper, salt, and raw egg, with enough flour to enable you
to roll into little balls. Fry these to a nice brown, drain
in a colander, and put into your tureen. Skim the boiling
soup and stir in the corn-starch wet with half a cup of milk,
then the tongue, skinned and cut into dice. Boil once
and pour into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Put into your dripping-pan; pour a cupful of boiling
water over it, and roast, basting often, allowing a quarter
of an hour to the pound. Towards the last, pepper and
salt, dredge with flour, and baste once well with butter.
If you send made gravy to the table, take off all the “top-grease,”
thicken the brown juice in the dripping-pan with
browned flour, boil up, and pour out into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Cut peeled potatoes into long strips, not too thin. Lay
in cold water one hour, dry between two towels, and fry
in boiling fat, a little salt, to a light brown. Drain and
dish upon a napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach upon Toast.</span></h3>

<p>Wash well. Cook twenty minutes in boiling, salted
water. Drain and chop very fine. Put a tablespoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
of butter into a saucepan with a teaspoonful of sugar, a
pinch of nutmeg, and pepper and salt. Stir in the spinach,
and beat smooth while it heats. At the last add a tablespoonful
of cream, or two of milk. Pour upon crustless
slices of buttered toast laid upon a flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus with Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a bunch of asparagus twenty minutes; cut off the
tender tops and lay in a deep pie-plate, buttering, salting,
and peppering well. Beat four eggs just enough to break
up the yolks, add a tablespoonful of melted butter, with
pepper and salt, and pour upon the asparagus. Bake eight
minutes in a quick oven, and serve immediately.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Starch Blanc-Mange with Preserves.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch wet in cold water.</li>
<li>3 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>Grated peel of half a lemon.</li>
<li>1 saltspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scald the milk in a farina-kettle; stir in corn-starch,
lemon, and salt, and cook five minutes. Pour this upon
the beaten eggs and sugar, return to the fire and stir two
minutes more. Pour into a wet mould and set in a cold
place for four or five hours. Turn out upon a broad
glass dish, and pour rich, sweet preserves about the base.</p>

<p>In helping it out, put a spoonful of preserve upon each
share of blanc-mange.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Purée of Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 can of tomatoes.</li>
<li>2 cups boiling milk with half a teaspoonful of soda stirred in.</li>
<li>1 heaping teaspoonful sugar.</li>
<li>1 small minced onion.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter rubbed up with one of flour.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>Handful of dry bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>1 cup of boiling water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put tomatoes and onion over the fire with the hot water.
Boil half an hour; strain and rub through a colander,
working the tomatoes to a pulp. Meanwhile, boil the
milk, stir in soda, butter and flour, and after one boil,
keep hot. Put pepper, salt, and sugar with the tomatoes;
simmer five minutes; pour into the tureen; stir in the
crumbs, and one minute later the thickened milk. Serve
at once. If the milk be cooked with the <i>purée</i>, it will
almost surely curdle.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Bass with Mushrooms.</span></h3>

<p>Clean a fine bass, and sew up in a thin cloth. Put into
boiling water in which you have mixed four tablespoonfuls
of vinegar, with six whole black peppers, and a little
salt. Cook about twelve minutes to the pound. Prepare
a cupful of drawn butter, boil half a can of mushrooms
twenty minutes; drain, chop up and stir, with the juice
of half a lemon and a little pepper, into the drawn butter.
Simmer together three minutes—put the fish upon a hot
dish, and pour one-third of the sauce over it, serving the
rest in a boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Sweetbreads.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 or 4 fine sweetbreads.</li>
<li>1 raw egg.</li>
<li>½ cup rolled crackers.</li>
<li>1 cup of gravy (saved from yesterday’s fricassee).</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls melted butter.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful mushroom or walnut catsup.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>Rounds of fried bread.</li>
</ul>

<p>Parboil and blanch the sweetbreads. Dry, and dip,
first, in egg, then, in cracker-crumbs. Lay in a small
dripping-pan; pour the butter over them, set in the oven,
and roast, covered, three-quarters of an hour, basting
often with the gravy. Dish upon fried bread. Add the catsup
to the gravy; boil up and strain over the sweetbreads.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare as usual, and pass with the fish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Succotash.</span></h3>

<p>Drain off the can liquor; cook the succotash half an
hour in boiling water; drain, add a cup of hot milk, and
stir in pepper, salt, and a great spoonful of butter cut up
in flour. Simmer three minutes and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberry Méringue.</span></h3>

<p>Make a good puff-paste, cut out large, and round as a
dinner-plate, and bake to a light brown in a quick oven.
Draw to the oven door; lay strawberries, rolled in sugar,
over it, and cover these an inch deep with a <i>méringue</i>
made of the whites of four eggs whisked stiff, with three
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. Bake until the
<i>méringue</i> is faintly tinged with yellow brown. Eat fresh,
but not hot. It is delicious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Amber Soup.</span></h3>

<p>This soup should be prepared very early in the day;
therefore, have the materials in the house overnight.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 lbs. lean beef.</li>
<li>2 slices of <i>lean</i> ham.</li>
<li>2 lbs. of veal-bones.</li>
<li>2 onions, sliced and fried.</li>
<li>1 carrot.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls essence of celery.</li>
<li>Pepper, and, if required, salt.</li>
<li>½ cup granulated tapioca.</li>
<li>Whites and shell of an egg.</li>
<li>5 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>Butter and dripping.</li>
<li>Burnt sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat into strips; put two tablespoonfuls of butter
into a soup-pot, and lay the meat in it. Let it stand
where it will heat slowly for half an hour. Then set over
the fire, and stir until the meat is glazed with a brownish
crust. Put a quart of water—cold—upon it, and bring
gradually to a boil. Fry the onion and carrot in dripping
to a fine brown, and drain off the fat, then put the vegetables
into the pot with the meat, as soon as the latter is
boiling hot. Cook half an hour; put in the rest of the cold
water, the minced ham, and the bones broken to bits. Boil
slowly four hours, then strain. Put meat and bones—highly
seasoned—into a stone vessel, and pour half the soup over
them for to-morrow. Put the rest back into the soup-kettle;
season and boil up. Skim with care; put in the
white and shell of an egg; boil three minutes; take from
the fire and pour into a broad pan to cool. Burn two
tablespoonfuls of sugar in a tin cup, on the hot range, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
while still liquid, pour in half a cupful of boiling water.
Let it stand thus until you are ready for it. The tapioca
should have been soaking two hours in a little cold water.
When the soup is cold, take off fat and scum—every particle;
return to the scalded pot; boil up once, put in tapioca,
and strain the sugar-water upon it. Simmer ten minutes,
or until the tapioca is clear; skim once again, and
pour out.</p>

<p>This is a fine company soup, but you should make it
once or twice for family dinners in order to manage it
properly. It is really not difficult.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ham and Omelette.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of ham, cut in <i>very</i> thin slices.</li>
<li>7 eggs.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of milk.</li>
<li>Pepper and a little salt.</li>
<li>1 large spoonful of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lay the ham in boiling water fifteen minutes, then let
it get cold. Cut off all the rind and trim each slice neatly;
then broil upon a greased gridiron. Pepper and keep hot
while you prepare the omelette. Beat whites and yolks
together with a few whirls of the beater; put in the milk
and beat fast for one minute; season and pour into a frying-pan
in which the butter is heating—not hissing. Shake
briskly over the fire, slipping your cake-turner under it to
prevent sticking, and in four minutes, double it over in
the middle and turn out into a hot dish by a dexterous
inversion of the pan. Lay the ham about it in the dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ladies’ Cabbage.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a firm cabbage in two waters, and let it get perfectly
cold. Chop fine; add two beaten eggs, a tablespoonful
of melted butter, pepper, salt, and a few spoonfuls
of milk. Stir all up well; put into a buttered bake-dish,
strew with fine crumbs; bake, covered, half an hour,
then brown quickly. Eat hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Buttered Rice.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a cup of rice soft in hot, salted water. Drain, and
heap in a deep dish. Fry an onion (sliced) very lightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
in two tablespoonfuls of butter; add pepper, and strain
the hot butter over the rice in the dish. Pass grated
cheese with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Summer Salad.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 heads of lettuce.</li>
<li>2 handfuls cresses.</li>
<li>1 cucumber, pared and sliced.</li>
<li>4 radishes, also pared and cut up.</li>
<li>3 hard-boiled eggs cut lengthwise into sixths.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut lettuces and cresses with a sharp knife, and mix
with the other vegetables in a bowl. Pour over them a
dressing made as directed on Thursday of the second
week in this month. Lay the sliced eggs on the top of all.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Irish Potato Pie.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 lb. mashed potato, rubbed through a colander.</li>
<li>½ lb. butter, creamed with the sugar.</li>
<li>6 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
<li>1 lemon, squeezed into the hot potato.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of nutmeg, and the same of mace.</li>
<li>2 cups of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix as you would cake, putting the whites in last, and
bake in open shells of paste. Eat cold.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">German Sago Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Soak half a cup of German sago in a little cold water
for two hours. Take the fat from the top of your soup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
stock, and pour off carefully from the bones, etc. If you
have any left from the “amber soup,” add that, and a
cupful of boiling water. Heat, season, and skim; put in
the sago, and simmer half an hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Lamb.</span></h3>

<p>Cook as you did the mutton, last Sunday, leaving out
the stuffing and omitting the egg and crumb coating at
the last. Roast about twelve minutes to the pound.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>See receipt for Saturday of second week in May.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Young Onions—Stewed.</span></h3>

<p>Cook ten minutes in boiling water; throw this off, and
pour on a cup of cold milk. Stew tender in this, add
pepper, salt, a tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour;
simmer five minutes and turn out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Puff.</span></h3>

<p>Mash the potatoes very soft, beating in butter, and
milk, and finally, the whipped white of an egg. Whisk to
a cream; heap roughly in a neat bake-dish and brown in
a good oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberries and Cream.</span></h3>

<p>Cap and pile the strawberries in a glass dish. Send
around powdered sugar and a pitcher of cream with them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Silver Cake.</span></h3>

<p>This delicate and handsome cake should have been

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Hotch-Potch.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. of lean beef.</li>
<li>1 lb. of good sausage-meat.</li>
<li>1 sliced onion.</li>
<li>1 sliced cucumber.</li>
<li>3 raw tomatoes peeled and sliced.</li>
<li>Handful of asparagus-tops.</li>
<li>1 sliced carrot.</li>
<li>¼ of a cabbage-heart, chopped fine.</li>
<li>½ cup of raw rice.</li>
<li>2 cups of green peas.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>Cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat small and put in alternate layers with the
vegetables and rice, into a stout stone jar. Pour in three
quarts of water, when you have seasoned the vegetables.
Fit a close cover on the jar, sealing around the edges with
a paste of flour and water. Set in the oven early in the
day and do not open for six hours; then pour into the
tureen. This is a good soup for Monday, and almost a
dinner in itself.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Minced Lamb.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the meat from the bone of your cold roast. Salt
the bone and put by for another day’s soup. Mince the
meat fine, season highly; put the gravy left from yesterday
(or a cup of your Sunday’s soup would be even better)
in a saucepan, when you have taken off the fat, heat
it, and stir in the mince. Make it very hot; thicken with
a little browned flour if it is too thin, and pile up in a flat
dish, with poached eggs and toast about it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Poached Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Nearly fill a frying-pan with boiling water. Add a little
salt and vinegar. Break your eggs, one at a time, into a
wet saucer, and slip from this upon the surface of the
water. Cook slowly three minutes; take up with a perforated
skimmer, and lay carefully upon rounds of buttered
toast laid around the minced lamb.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Cakes.</span></h3>

<p>Work cold mashed potato—or the remains of your
“puff,” soft with a little melted butter and milk; knead
into it enough prepared flour to enable you to roll it out
into a sheet half an inch thick. Cut into rounds like biscuit,
and bake in a floured pan rather quickly to a good
brown. Glaze with butter just before you take them out.
Eat hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Please see receipt for last Monday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bread Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups fine crumbs.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>¼ lb. of citron cut into short shavings.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>¼ teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and mace.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of brandy.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful melted butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk to a soft paste. Put a
layer of this into a buttered bake-dish. Sprinkle with citron,
then spice, and cover with more soaked crumbs.
Having nearly filled the dish in this order, pour over all
the eggs whipped light with sugar, butter, and brandy.
Bake covered twenty-five minutes, then brown. Eat
warm. It will need no sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cracker Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>The cracked bone of the cold lamb.</li>
<li>1 lb. lean mutton, chopped up.</li>
<li>½ lb. Boston crackers, split.</li>
<li>2 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>2 cups boiling milk, with a pinch of soda stirred in.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter, cut up in one teaspoonful of flour.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and a pinch of mace.</li>
<li>1 sliced onion.</li>
<li>A little chopped parsley.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put meat, onion, and bones on in the water and cook
slowly two hours. Strain and cool, and take off every
particle of fat. While the soup is cooling, put your
crackers into a bowl, or tin pail, salting and peppering
them. Pour on the milk, cover closely, and set for half
an hour in boiling water at one side of the range. Return
the broth to the fire, season and skim as it heats. Now
strain the milk from the crackers, if it be not all absorbed,
and turn them, with care, into your tureen. They should
be like a jelly, yet retain their shape. Stir into the soup
the floured butter and parsley; boil one minute and pour
slowly upon the crackers. Set the tureen in hot water—covered—ten
minutes, before sending to the table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak and Onion.</span></h3>

<p>Broil the steak in the usual manner and lay upon a hot
dish. Pepper and salt, and strain over it three tablespoonfuls
of butter in which a sliced Bermuda onion has
simmered—not browned—for ten minutes. Cover with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
a hot tin platter for five minutes, and make cuts in the
steak, here and there, to draw out the juices and enable
the butter to penetrate it. This is a nicer way of flavoring
a steak than the usual fashion of serving the onion
with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Boil twenty minutes in hot, salted water, with a lump
of white sugar, unless the peas are newly gathered from
the home garden. When tender, drain well, pepper, and
add a generous lump of butter. Serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Corn.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of sweet corn; drain and chop it fine.
Beat up three eggs with a tablespoonful of sugar, the same
of butter, two cups of milk, pepper and salt to taste. Stir
in the corn and bake forty-five minutes in a buttered pudding-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cress-Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Cut up—not too small—pile in a salad-bowl, sprinkle
with sugar, and pour over it a dressing made by working
up a saltspoonful each of salt, pepper, and made mustard
with two tablespoonfuls of oil, and when this is well mixed,
adding, a few drops at a time, and whipping these in with
an egg-beater, four tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Toss up
with a silver fork.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jersey Puffs.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart Hecker’s prepared flour, sifted with a saltspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter melted in 2 cups of hot milk.</li>
<li>5 eggs—very well whisked.</li>
</ul>

<p>While milk and butter are cooling—a little above
blood-heat—beat in the yolks, then the flour, and let the
batter get stone cold before whipping in the frothed
whites. Bake in greased muffin rings in a quick oven.
Serve as soon as they are baked. Tear open with your
fingers, and eat with liquid sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scotch Broth.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. scrag of mutton, the meat sliced and bones broken.</li>
<li>2 chopped carrots.</li>
<li>2 young turnips, sliced.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>Rather more than ½ cup of barley.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
<li>1 quart of green peas.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put on the mutton and all the vegetables, except the
peas, in the water, and cook slowly four hours. Meanwhile,
soak the barley in a cup of tepid water. Strain
the broth, pulping the vegetables through the colander.
Let it cool, and take off the fat. Season, put over the
fire, skim when it reaches the boil, and add peas and
barley. Simmer steadily half an hour, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Chickens and Pork.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and stuff a pair of chickens. Slice half a
pound of fat salt pork very thin and bind with soft strings
over the breasts and upper parts of the bodies. Lay in a
dripping-pan; pour in a cup of boiling water, and roast
one hour in a good oven, basting often. Then clip the
strings, lay the pork in the pan; dredge the chickens with
flour, and, as this colors, baste once with butter, and twice
afterwards with gravy. When the chickens are done to a
fine brown, lay upon a hot dish with the pork about them.
Strain and skim the gravy, pepper it, thicken with a little
browned flour and serve in a boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>The green tops of two bunches of asparagus, boiled tender, left to cool, and cut up small.</li>
<li>4 eggs, well beaten.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful melted butter.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls prepared flour.</li>
<li>1 scant cup of milk, with a pinch of soda stirred in.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat eggs, butter, pepper and salt together; add the
flour; then, by degrees, the milk, finally the asparagus.
Put into a well-greased mould with a top, and cook in a
pot of boiling water nearly two hours. Turn out upon a
dish and pour a cup of drawn butter over it. It is very
nice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare in the customary way, taking care not to have
them too stiff.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Pare with a sharp knife; slice and lay in a salad-bowl.
Make a dressing such as was directed yesterday for your
cresses, with the addition of the yolks of two hard-boiled
eggs, <i>powdered</i>, and worked in with the oil, pepper, etc.
Pour over the tomatoes, and set upon ice for an hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Blanc-Mange.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart milk.</li>
<li>1 package Cooper’s gelatine, soaked for one hour in a cup of cold water.</li>
<li>4 heaping tablespoonfuls of chocolate wet in a little milk.</li>
<li>¾ of a cup of sugar.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla essence.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the milk; stir in sugar and gelatine, and when
these are dissolved, the chocolate. Cook five minutes,
stirring all the time, and strain through double tarlatan,
into a wet mould. Set upon ice to form. When firm,
turn out and eat with sweet cream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle Soup.</span></h3>

<p>As I stated, after writing out the receipt in full for
this soup (see Wednesday—Third Week in March), I
shall not repeat it in this volume. Please, therefore, refer
to the minute directions then given, and follow them in
preparing to-day’s soup—<i>only</i> leaving out the brains in
the force-meat. You may make enough soup for two
days, keeping that for Friday upon the ice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Corned Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Select a piece not too salt. The brisket is a good cut
for family use, when not too fat. Boil in plenty of hot
water, allowing fifteen minutes per pound. Make a good
cup of drawn butter, taking some of the beef-liquor—strained—as
a base. Chop up a little parsley and half a
pickled onion, and stir into the butter one minute before
pouring it out into a sauce-boat. Save the liquor for Saturday.
For directions for making drawn butter and other
sauces, please consult “General Receipts,” page 183.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Young Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and quarter. Cook in boiling water, a little salted,
about half an hour, or until tender. Drain, but do not
mash. Pepper and salt, then butter, after dishing them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Casserole of Rice with Calf’s Brains.</span></h3>

<p>Make a cupful of gravy from the bones and stuffing of
yesterday’s chickens. Cool and skim it. Soak a cup of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
rice two hours in two cups of cold water; drain this off;
put the rice into a farina-kettle with the gravy, previously
heated to a boil, and a cup of boiling water. Season
with salt and pepper, and cook tender, shaking up once
in a while, but not stirring. When the rice is nearly dry,
make a rounded hillock of it in the middle of a dish;
strew with grated cheese, and brown upon the upper
grating of the oven.</p>

<p>Boil the calf’s brains ten minutes; lay in cold water
twice as long. Then dry well and beat up with an egg,
pepper, salt, and a very little flour. Fry, by the spoonful,
in hot fat, drain, and lay around the rice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Pea Fritters.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 pint boiled green peas, mashed while hot, with pepper, butter, and salt.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>Less than ½ cup prepared flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat eggs, milk, and mashed peas smooth, then add the
flour and fry upon a griddle as you would breakfast-cakes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bananas, Oranges, Nuts and Raisins.</span></h3>

<p>Pile bananas and oranges together, garnishing with green
leaves. Put nuts and raisins upon two smaller dishes.
Pass all at the same course.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tea, Toasted Crackers, and Cheese.</span></h3>

<p>If you have a hot-water pot and a spirit-lamp, make the
tea upon the table a few minutes before it is needed, then
cover the pot with a “cozy.” This is a pretty English
fashion which, I am glad to see, is gaining ground in our
country. Butter the split crackers while hot, and send
around with the tea and cheese.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Yesterday’s Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the top of the cake of soup-jelly you
will find in the refrigerator, and warm the stock cautiously,
lest it should scorch. It should not quite boil.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lobster Fricassee.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Meat of one large lobster, boiled and cold.</li>
<li>1 cup of your soup.</li>
<li>½ cup of milk.</li>
<li>Juice of half a lemon.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter, rolled in flour.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt to liking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the lobster into dice. Put the gravy, pepper, and
salt into a saucepan, and, when hot, the lobster. Cook
gently five minutes, and put in the lemon. Heat the milk
in another vessel, stir in the floured butter; boil up; turn
into a deep bowl. Pour the lobster in also, stir up faithfully,
and turn into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Pasty.</span></h3>

<p>Chop your cold, boiled beef fine; season with pepper
and add the remains of yesterday’s drawn butter, or make
more if you have none, putting in parsley and onion
pickle, chopped. Pour this mixture into a greased bake-dish;
cover with hard-boiled eggs, sliced. Work a large
cup of mashed potato soft with a cup of milk and two
tablespoonfuls of butter. Add prepared flour until you
can just roll it out—the softer the better, so long as you
can handle it. Roll into a thick sheet; spread upon the
surface of your mince, printing the edges, and bake in a
moderate oven to a fine brown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String-Beans.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberry Shortcake with Cream.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of powdered sugar, creamed with one tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of prepared flour, heaping.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of cream.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the yolks into the creamed butter and sugar; the
cream, then the whites, alternately with the flour. Bake
in three jelly-cake tins. When cold, lay between the
cakes nearly a quart of fresh, ripe strawberries. Sprinkle
each layer with powdered sugar, and sift the same whitely
over the top. Eat fresh with cream poured upon each
slice.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pea and Potato Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>The liquor in which your beef was boiled on Thursday.</li>
<li>10 parboiled potatoes.</li>
<li>1 pint of green peas.</li>
<li>1 sliced onion.</li>
<li>½ cup raw rice.</li>
<li>Pepper and parsley.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take the fat from the liquor, and put on with the onion
and potatoes, sliced. Cook one hour; strain, rubbing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
vegetables through the sieve. Pepper, and return to the
fire with the rice, parsley, and peas. Stew half an hour,
or until the rice is tender. Pour out and serve. Dip up
from the bottom in helping it out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Mutton Cutlets.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of mutton cutlets.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>2 raw tomatoes, chopped.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>½ cup of boiling water.</li>
<li>Browned flour and currant jelly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the butter into a saucepan, and lay in the cutlets,
then the tomatoes. Set where they will heat very slowly
for one hour. Then turn the meat, add the boiling
water, and stew steadily—not fast—half an hour, keeping
the pan closely covered. Lay the cutlets upon a hot
dish, strain the gravy back into the saucepan, thicken
with a little browned flour, stir in a heaping teaspoonful
of currant jelly, and when this has melted, pour over the
meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Cook as directed on Tuesday of this week.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>See “Tomato Salad” on Wednesday. Leave out the

<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Scallops.</span></h3>

<p>Mash the potatoes light with a little milk, and an <i>even</i>
tablespoonful of butter for every cupful. Salt and pepper
to taste. Fill buttered patty-pans, or scallop-shells with
the mixture, sift fine crumbs over the tops, and brown in
a good oven. Serve in the shells.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fig Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ lb. best white figs, washed, dried, and minced.</li>
<li>2 cups of fine crumbs.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>½ cup of beef-suet, powdered.</li>
<li>2 scant cups of milk.</li>
<li>½ cup of white sugar.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
<li>A pinch of soda, dissolved in hot water, and stirred into the milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk. Stir in the eggs beaten
light with the sugar, suet, salt, and figs. Beat hard three
minutes; pour into a buttered mould and boil two hours
and a half. Eat hot with wine sauce.</p>

<h2>JUNE.</h2>

——<br />
Snow Custard.<br />
——<br />
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">All-night Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 lbs. of coarse lean beef.</li>
<li>3 slices of lean ham.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>2 blades of mace.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>6 tomatoes.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>½ cupful of German sago.</li>
<li>4 quarts of water.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of walnut catsup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat into dice, and chop the vegetables. Season,
as you put them with sago and herbs in close layers,
into a jar with a tight top. About eight o’clock on Saturday
night, set this in a pot of boiling water (having tied a
thick cloth over the lid of the jar) and cook until bed-time.
Leave pot and jar upon the range. When the fire
is built next day see that there is plenty of water in the
pot, and pay no more attention to your soup, except to
replenish the water in the pot with more, as hot from the
tea-kettle, until half an hour before dinner is served.
Then strain the contents of the jar, pressing the vegetables
to a pulp. Divide the broth into two portions.
Return one to the jar, with the meat, and set, when cold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
in the refrigerator for to-morrow. Put the other into a
saucepan, boil two minutes, skim, add the catsup, and
pour into the tureen. Mem.: <i>Never</i> forget to let the
soup stand in a broad bowl after straining, long enough
for the fat to rise and be skimmed off.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Beef and Round Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Roast the meat in the usual manner, and, about half
an hour before taking it out, pour off three-quarters of
the gravy from the dripping-pan and lay about the meat
some balls of mashed potato, worked smooth, with pepper,
salt and a raw egg, moulded in your hands, and
rolled in flour. Turn as they brown, and, when done,
drain off the grease, and dish with the beef.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Macaroni.</span></h3>

<p>Break half a pound of macaroni into short pieces; cook
about twenty minutes in salted boiling water. It should
be clear at the edges, but not ragged. Drain well, pepper
and salt, and stir in a tablespoonful of butter. Strew
grated cheese over the top when dished, and pass more
with it at table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Cook from twenty to twenty-five minutes in boiling
water, a little salt. Drain very well when tender, stir in
a great lump of peppered butter, and serve hot in a vegetable
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Snow Custard.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ package of Coxe’s gelatine.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>2 cups of sugar.</li>
<li>Juice of one lemon.</li>
<li>2 cups of boiling water.</li>
<li>Vanilla, or other essence.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the gelatine one hour in a cup of cold water.
Add then a pint of boiling water, and stir until the gelatine
is dissolved. Put in two-thirds of the sugar and all
the lemon-juice. Beat the whites of the eggs stiff, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
when the gelatine is quite cold, whip it in, a spoonful at a
time, for half an hour with the “Dover”—an hour, if you
use the common egg-whisk. When all is a white sponge,
put into a wet mould to form. Make a custard of the
milk, yolks, and the reserved sugar, flavor as you like, and
when the “snow” is turned out into a glass dish, pour
this around the base. Prepare this dessert on Saturday,
and keep in the refrigerator. It is very nice.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Peel, by pouring boiling water over them, a dozen fine
tomatoes, cut them up, throwing aside the hard cores and
unripe portions. Take the fat from the surface of your
soup stock; pour it off from the meat and sediment; add
the tomatoes, and stew gently half an hour. Strain, rubbing
the tomatoes through the sieve; return to the pot;
add a little pepper and salt, a lump of sugar, and a tablespoonful
of butter rolled in flour. Boil one minute, and
pour out. It will be a delicious soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Make perpendicular incisions in your cold roast, having
trimmed the top smoothly, and thrust in lardoons of fat
salt pork, set closely together. Take the fat from the
cold gravy, and add to the latter a little minced onion, a
tablespoonful of catsup, and a large cup of boiling water.
Lay the meat in a dripping-pan, pour the gravy upon it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
invert another pan over it, and cook in a moderate oven
about an hour. Turn the meat once, and baste six times
with the gravy. Dish the meat; strain the gravy, thicken
it with browned flour, boil up and pour into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Cream Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and cut into neat dice. Leave in cold water half
an hour; then cook as long in boiling water, salted.
Drain this off before the potatoes break; add half a cup
of milk (or cream) with a pinch of soda. When it heats,
stir in a generous lump of butter cut up in a teaspoonful
of flour, and a mere pinch of finely-grated lemon-peel.
Stew one minute and pour into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach Dressed with Egg.</span></h3>

<p>Boil the spinach in plenty of hot water, salted, for
twenty minutes. Drain and press out the water. Chop
fine; put back over the fire with a large spoonful of butter,
and a teaspoonful of sugar, with salt and pepper to taste,
also a little nutmeg. Beat until hot and smooth; turn
into a hot, deep dish, and cover with a dressing of the
yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, left to cool, then pounded
in a Wedgewood mortar, and rubbed to a paste with a
teaspoonful of melted butter, one of cream, and lastly, one
of lemon-juice. Spread over the surface of the spinach and
garnish with a border of the sliced whites.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberries and Cream.</span></h3>

<p>Cap the berries, and pile in a glass bowl. Do <i>not</i> sugar
them, but pass powdered sugar and cream with each
saucerful.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Martha’s Cake.</span></h3>

<p>An economical and very nice variety of jelly-cake, easily
made, and which keeps well. Please see “<span class="smcap">Common Sense
in the Household</span>” Series No. 1, “General Receipts,”

<h3><span class="smcap">Quick Beef Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. of lean beef, chopped <i>very</i> fine.</li>
<li>3 pints of water.</li>
<li>1 grated carrot.</li>
<li>1 onion, sliced.</li>
<li>1 grated turnip.</li>
<li>1 clove.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of tomato catsup.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put onion and other vegetables with spice on in two
quarts of water, and boil down to three pints. Strain and
press over the beef. Season with pepper, salt, and catsup;
simmer half an hour, or until the meat is nearly white and
the soup brown, and serve with the meat in it. The vegetable
liquor must be boiling when it is poured upon the
minced beef.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lamb Chops.</span></h3>

<p>Broil quickly over a clear fire; pepper and salt; butter
on both sides, and lay in a heap, symmetrically arranged,
in the centre of a dish, surrounded by the potato purée.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Purée of Potatoes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of hot, mashed potatoes, rubbed through a colander.</li>
<li>½ cup of milk.</li>
<li>1 large spoonful of butter.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix all up well; put into a <i>greased</i> saucepan, and
stir until hot, never allowing it to stick to the sides or
scorch, and lay, in a white hedge, about the chops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus Rolls.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>8 or 10 stale French rolls.</li>
<li>2 bunches of asparagus.</li>
<li>Yolks of 2 raw eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter, rolled in a very little flour.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut off the top of each roll; pick out the crumb carefully,
and set the hollowed rolls, with their tops, in a slow
oven to dry to crispness. Boil the asparagus twenty minutes,
cut off the green tops, and let them get perfectly
cold. Then heat the milk; stir in the butter; pour upon
the beaten yolks; beat one minute with your egg-whisk;
return to the fire; put in the asparagus-tops—minced—leaving
out as many whole tops as you have rolls—stir
until very hot, but not until it boils. Fill your rolls with
the mixture; make a round hole in the top of each crust-cover;
fit in a bit of asparagus, as if it had sprouted from
below; fit each cover upon its roll, and the pretty and
delightful dish is ready.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce.</span></h3>

<p>Pick hearts and blanched leaves from the stems; pile
in a salad-bowl, and cover with a dressing made of two
tablespoonfuls of oil, one teaspoonful of white sugar, half
as much each of salt, pepper, and made mustard—all
rubbed smooth together—then thickened, rather than
thinned, by whipping in a few drops at a time, four tablespoonfuls
of vinegar. Stir up with a silver fork after the
dressing goes on.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rosie’s Rice Custard.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>3 well-beaten eggs.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>1 small cup of boiled and still warm rice.</li>
<li>1 scant tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream butter and sugar; add the beaten eggs, salt,
then, the rice stirred warm into the milk. Bake in a
buttered dish half an hour in a quick oven. Eat warm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Broth.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 large chicken, jointed as for fricassee.</li>
<li>½ cup of raw rice.</li>
<li>5 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>Chopped parsley, pepper, and salt.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put water and chicken on quite early in the day, and cook
slowly until the water has boiled down to about three and
a half quarts, and the chicken slips easily from the bones.
Take off all the meat, and return the bones to the pot.
Cook gently until an hour before dinner, when strain, and
let it cool. Take off the fat; return to the fire—with the
seasoning and rice—and simmer half an hour, or until the
rice is soft. Have the milk heated in a separate vessel,
with a pinch of soda; pour upon the beaten eggs; put
back over the fire, and stir until it begins to thicken.
Turn into the tureen. Boil up the chicken broth once
sharply, and add to the milk in the soup-tureen, stirring
up well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Shad au Gratin.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and wipe a fine roe-shad. Take off head,
tail, and fins, and cut into eight pieces. Pepper and salt
these; dip into beaten egg, then in cracker-crumbs, and
fry in hot dripping or lard. Drain, and serve on a hot,
flat dish. The roes should be parboiled, then cooled—afterward
dipped in egg and cracker, fried in the same
manner as the fish, and dished with it.</p>


<h3><b>Milanaise Pudding.</b></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ lb. cold cooked ham.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>The meat of your soup-chicken.</li>
<li>Nearly ½ lb. of macaroni.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>A cup of your soup, strained and skimmed before the rice is put in.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the macaroni in the broth until tender; then let
it cool somewhat, and, with a pair of old scissors, clip it
into inch lengths. Chop ham and chicken, and pepper.
Mix with the macaroni—which should have absorbed the
broth—stir in the melted butter and eggs. Put into a
well-greased mould, and boil an hour and a half. Turn
out; pour over it a cup of drawn butter, and serve. Pass
grated cheese with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare as usual and pass with the fish course.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Navy Beans.</span></h3>

<p>This is a variety of white kidney beans. Shell and lay
them in cold water half an hour, to take off the raw, rank
taste. Cook about twenty-five minutes in boiling water,
a little salt. Drain well; pepper, salt, and butter. Eat
hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cottage Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of sweet milk.</li>
<li>3 cups of flour, or enough for pretty stiff batter. (Use Hecker’s prepared flour.)</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream butter and sugar; beat in the yolks, then the
salted flour, alternately with the whites. Bake in a buttered
cake-mould until a straw will come up clean from
the middle. Turn out and eat hot with sweet sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">White Asparagus Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. knuckle of veal.</li>
<li>1 slice of corned ham.</li>
<li>3 bunches of well-bleached asparagus, cut into short pieces.</li>
<li>4 quarts of water.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of corn-starch.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, chopped parsley, and dice of fried bread.</li>
</ul>

<p>Crack the bones to splinters and chop the meat. Put
on with all the asparagus stalks and one-half of the heads.
Cover with the water and cook gently, covered, three
hours. Strain; cool to let the grease rise; skim and return
to the pot with the seasoning and reserved heads of
asparagus. Boil slowly for twenty minutes longer. Heat
the milk separately, salt and pepper, and stir in the corn-starch,
boiling one minute to thicken it. Pour into the
tureen upon the dice of fried bread; stir into this the boiling
soup, and send to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Fillet of Veal with Bacon.</span></h3>

<p>Take out the bone from the meat, and pin into a round
with skewers. Bind securely with soft tapes. Fill the
cavity left by the bone with a force-meat of crumbs, chopped
pork; thyme, and parsley, seasoned with pepper, salt, nutmeg,
and a pinch of lemon-peel. Cover the top of the
fillet with thin slices of cold, <i>cooked</i>, fat bacon or salt pork,
tying them in place with twines crossing the meat in all
directions. Put into a pot with two cups of boiling water,
and cook slowly and steadily two hours. Then take from
the pot and put into a dripping-pan. Undo the strings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
and tapes. Brush the meat all over with raw egg, sift
rolled cracker thickly over it, and set in the oven for half
an hour, basting often with gravy from the pot. When it
is well browned, lay upon a hot dish with the pork about
it. Strain and thicken the gravy, and serve in a boat.</p>

<p>If your fillet be large, cook twice as long in the pot.
The time given above is for one weighing five pounds.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scooped Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and cut round with a potato-gouge—a neat little
instrument that costs but a trifle. The waste bits can be
boiled, mashed, and set by for to-morrow’s uses. Boil the
scooped pellets in hot, salted water twenty minutes; throw
this off and put in a cup of cold milk. Simmer gently
until the potatoes are tender; stir in a good lump of butter
rolled in flour, and when this is melted, a little minced
parsley, with pepper and salt. Stew three minutes, and
pour into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Pare with a keen knife; arrange upon a glass dish and
cover with a dressing like that made on Tuesday for lettuce,
but adding the beaten yolks of two raw eggs, whipped
in the last thing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hominy Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cupful cold, boiled, small-grained hominy.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>1 heaping tablespoonful of melted butter.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of sugar.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the hominy very smooth with the butter; then the
yolks, beaten up with the sugar. Beat well before thinning
with the salted milk. Lastly, add the frothed whites.
Bake in a greased pudding-dish until nicely browned.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoanut Puddings.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 lb. of cocoanut, grated.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>½ lb. of powdered sugar.</li>
<li>1 quart rich milk.</li>
<li>5 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful nutmeg.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scald the milk and pour, gradually, upon the beaten
eggs. Do not return to the fire, but, when nearly cold,
season, add the cocoanut; stir up well; pour into buttered
cups, and bake by setting in a pan of boiling water,
and stirring again as the custard begins to heat, that the
cocoanut may not settle to the bottom. Bake until well
“set,” and slightly browned. Eat cold.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clam Chowder.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>100 clams.</li>
<li>1 sliced onion.</li>
<li>12 butter or other small crackers, that can be split.</li>
<li>12 tomatoes, peeled and chopped.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful minced parsley and half the quantity of mixed thyme, summer savory and sweet marjoram.</li>
<li>A large pinch of mace and the same of cayenne pepper.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk—hot—for soaking the crackers, and butter for spreading them.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls butter for chowder.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put a layer of clams in the bottom of a soup-pot, next
one of sliced tomatoes and onion. Sprinkle with seasoning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
and drop bits of butter upon them. More clams,
more tomato, etc., until all are in. Pour on the liquor—there
should be at least three pints—cover, heat slowly
for half an hour, then boil quite briskly for twenty minutes.
Meanwhile, soak the split crackers—covered—in the
boiling milk. When soft all through, butter thickly, and
keep warm over boiling water until the soup is ready.
Then line a hot tureen with them, and pour in the chowder.
Pass sliced lemon with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Pickerel.</span></h3>

<p>Select a couple of large, fresh fish; score the back-bones
with a sharp knife, and lay them in a baking-pan. Pour
a cupful of boiling water over them, cover, and bake
slowly, basting with butter and water, at least six times.
The fish should be tender, yet firm when done. Transfer
them carefully to a hot-water dish. Have ready a cupful
of rich, drawn butter; strain the gravy from the dripping-pan
into it, with a little minced parsley. Heat almost to
a boil and pour over the fish. There is no better way of
cooking large pickerel than this.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Scallop.</span></h3>

<p>Chop the remains of your fillet fine, and season with
pepper and salt. Put a layer of dry crumbs in a buttered
bake-dish; stick bits of butter over it; cover with the
meat and wet this with gravy and warm milk. Repeat
this order of strata until your dish is full, covering deep
with crumbs. Fit a tin cover on the top and bake half
an hour; remove the lid and brown nicely. Serve in the
bake-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes—Browned.</span></h3>

<p>Mash soft with milk and butter; whip up to a cream;
season, and make into a four-sided pyramid upon a
greased pie-dish. Brown in a good oven and slip to a
warm dish. Pass with the fish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Please see receipt given on Sunday of this week.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberry Shortcake.</span></h3>

<p>Please see receipt given on Friday of Fourth Week in
May. The strawberry season is so short that you can
hardly give this popular dessert often enough to weary
your family while the scarlet, flavorous beauties last.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tea,</span></h3>

<p>Hot and strong, will be the better for a little cream borrowed
from the supply meant for your shortcake.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Marlowe Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. of lean veal and the same of lean beef.</li>
<li>1 lb. of lean ham.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>1 carrot.</li>
<li>1 turnip.</li>
<li>¼ of a head of cabbage, chopped and parboiled.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>6 tomatoes, peeled and sliced.</li>
<li>½ cup of rice.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>5 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut up meat and vegetables fine, and put with the
water into the soup-kettle. Cook slowly four hours.
Strain the soup, rubbing the vegetables through the colander.
Divide the liquor into two parts. Put with the
meat—all highly seasoned—into a stoneware vessel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
set by in the refrigerator. Let the other portion cool;
take off the fat; season; put over the fire; boil and
skim for a few minutes, and put in the rice. Simmer very
gently half an hour, or until the rice is very soft.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef’s Tongue—(Langue du Bœuf).</span></h3>

<p>Wash a large, perfectly fresh tongue in three waters.
Then cover well with boiling water, a little salt—plenty
of it—and cook about twelve minutes to the pound.
Strip off the skin; dish, when you have trimmed away
the root, and pour over it the following sauce: Strain a
cup of the liquor in which the tongue was boiled; set
over the fire, and stir in two tablespoonfuls of butter cut
up in flour, pepper to taste; the juice of a lemon, and
when this has thickened, two small pickled cucumbers,
chopped. This is a dish whose merits deserve to be better
known. (Save the liquor.)</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Squeezed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Put on in cold water, and bring quickly to a boil.
When soft enough to be pierced by a fork, turn off the
water; throw in a little salt, and dry on the range. Tear
off the skins quickly, and as soon as each is bare, envelop
it in the corner of a dry, hot towel and twist the same
tightly around it for a second, but not <i>quite</i> breaking it.
Pile within a napkin-lined dish, and send up hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">French Beans—Sautés.</span></h3>

<p>Top, tail, and “string” with care. Cut into short
pieces. Cook in boiling water, a little salt, until tender—say
thirty minutes, if they are full-grown. Drain well;
return to the saucepan with two great spoonfuls of butter,
salt, pepper, and a teaspoonful of vinegar. Toss until
very hot, and turn into a hot, deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Young Beets.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in hot, salt water one hour. When done, rub off
the skins; split the beets lengthwise and lay upon a hot
dish. Have ready a great spoonful of melted butter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
mixed with two of vinegar, a little salt and pepper, heated
to boiling, and pour over the beets. Be careful not to
break the skin of raw beets, or they will lose their color
in the hot water while cooking.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherry Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Line your pie-dish with a good paste; fill with a mixture
of sour and sweet cherries; sweeten plentifully;
cover with paste printed at the edge and slit in the middle,
and bake until nicely colored. Eat fresh, but not
warm, with white sugar sifted over the top.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato and Pea Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the liquor in which the tongue was
boiled yesterday; set it over the fire, and, when boiling,
put in the empty pods of two quarts of peas. Boil half
an hour; take from the fire and strain out the pods.
About half an hour before dinner, take the fat from the
“stock” set aside yesterday, and pour off from the meat
and sediment into the soup-pot. While it is slowly heating,
put on the water in which the pods were boiled, with
the peas and two quarts of peeled and sliced tomatoes,
in another pot, and bring more rapidly to the boil. Cook
twenty-five minutes, then stir in two lumps of white
sugar, two tablespoonfuls of butter, rolled in flour, pepper
well, boil up, and rub through a colander into the main
soup-kettle. Simmer all together three minutes, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
fit for use. Pour half into the tureen; cool the rest and
remand to the refrigerator.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Lamb with Mushroom Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Let your butcher take out the bones from the lower
side of a shoulder of lamb, leaving in the shank. Fill
the cavity thus left with a good force-meat of crumbs,
chopped pork, and sweet herbs, and sew the meat edges
together to hold it in. If you have no gravy ready make
a pint on Saturday of the lamb trimmings and a few veal-bones,
with seasoning. It need not be strong. Put the
lamb into a broad pot, with some thin slices of fat pork
laid in the bottom; pour in the gravy, cover tightly, and
stew gently one hour. Turn the meat then, and cook
twenty minutes longer. Lay the lamb upon a hot dish,
and butter it all over. Cover, and keep warm over hot
water while you make the sauce. Have ready half a can
of mushrooms, boiled and chopped. Strain the gravy left
in the pot, add the mushrooms, and stew five minutes;
thicken with browned flour; boil up and pour over the
lamb. Garnish with alternate slices of green pickle and
boiled beets.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Shell; lay in cold water twenty minutes, and cook in
slightly salted boiling water <i>about</i> half an hour, or until
tender. The time depends much upon age and size.
Drain well; pour into a deep dish; pepper, salt, and
butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Receipt given on Sunday of First Week in this month.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and slice young turnips. Boil fifteen minutes in
hot, salted water; throw this off, and add half a cup of
milk and as much boiling fresh water. When this heats,
stir in a generous lump of butter, rolled in a teaspoonful
of flour, with pepper and salt to taste. Simmer ten minutes
longer, or until tender, and pour into a deep dish.
Eat very hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Blanc-Mange.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 large lemon, or two small ones—all the juice and half the grated peel.</li>
<li>Whisked whites of 4 eggs.</li>
<li>1 package of gelatine soaked two hours in one cup of cold water.</li>
<li>1 pint and 1 cup of <i>boiling</i> water.</li>
<li>2 cups of powdered sugar—even ones.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of nutmeg.</li>
<li>1 glass of good claret.</li>
</ul>

<p>Add to the soaked gelatine the lemon-juice and peel,
sugar and spice. Leave standing one hour. Then pour
on the boiling water. Stir until clear, add the wine, and
strain through double tarlatan. While it is cooling, whip
the whites very stiff. When the gelatine begins to coagulate
around the edge of the dish, whip it, little by little,
into the frothed whites until it is stiff. Put into a wet
mould, and set upon the ice. On Sunday turn it out, and
pour a rich liqueur—that from brandied peaches is best—about
the base. Preserved strawberries are also very
nice with it if you have no liqueur.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee and Cake.</span></h3>

<p>If you prefer, you can give the cake with the blanc-mange,
and drink the coffee afterwards.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">“Once-Again” Soup.</span></h3>

<p>A good soup, founded upon such stock as you made
on Saturday, is better the third day than the first. Therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
take off the fat from the portion kept on the ice
since yesterday’s providential division, and warm it slowly,
<i>almost</i> to a boil. If you have time, cut some fried bread
into dice and put into the tureen before you pour in the
soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Lamb.</span></h3>

<p>Do not murder the well-cooked, juicy innocent of yesterday
by hashing and reheating. A nice dish of cold
lamb, trimmed and garnished with cresses and cool, white
lettuce, is goodly to the eyes—and taste—on a sultry June
day.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Fondu.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups milk, with a pinch of soda stirred in.</li>
<li>1 cup very dry, fine crumbs.</li>
<li>½ lb. of dry cheese, grated.</li>
<li>4 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of melted butter.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and a pinch of mace.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk; beat in the eggs, butter,
seasoning—lastly, the cheese. Butter a pudding-dish;
put in the mixture; strew the top with fine crumbs, and
bake, covered, half an hour; then brown quickly. Eat
soon, as it will fall in cooling.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>See receipt for Tuesday of first week in this month for
dressing lettuce, when you have peeled and sliced the
tomatoes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes en Robe de Chambre.</span></h3>

<p>If you use Bermuda potatoes, cook in boiling water.
If you take old potatoes, put on in cold and bring rapidly
to a boil. Throw off the water when they are done, set
back on the range, uncovered, to dry out, and send to
table with the skins on.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Floating Island.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>4 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>4 heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls extract of bitter almond.</li>
<li>½ cup of currant jelly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat yolks and sugar light, and pour on, by degrees,
the boiling milk. Pour back into the farina-kettle, and
heat, stirring constantly until it begins to thicken. When
cold, flavor, and pour into a glass dish. Pile with a <i>méringue</i>
of the whites beaten up with half a cup of currant
jelly. Ornament with dots of jelly.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Summer Mélange Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. lean beef, chopped fine.</li>
<li>1 quart green peas.</li>
<li>1 quart tomatoes, peeled and sliced.</li>
<li>1 cucumber, sliced thin.</li>
<li>1 sliced onion.</li>
<li>1 pint of small string-beans, cut into pieces.</li>
<li>3 great spoonfuls of butter, rolled in flour.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>4 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put on the meat in the water, and cook, slowly, three
hours, to extract every particle of nourishment from the
beef. Peel and slice the vegetables, and lay all, except
the tomatoes, in cold water for half an hour. At the end
of the three hours, strain the soup; return to the pot and
put in all the vegetables with salt and pepper. Stew for
one hour, covered; stir in the butter and simmer half an
hour longer before turning it out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rolled Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Make your butcher take <i>all</i> the bones out of a rib-roast.
(Keep them for to-morrow’s soup.) Make him also roll the
meat into a round, and skewer it securely. Wash it all over
with vinegar, then rub with hot butter mixed with minced
onion and pepper, working this well between the folds
of meat. Put into the dripping-pan, pour a cup of gravy
from the boiling soup—before the vegetables are added—about
the base, and a few spoonfuls of butter and water
upon the top. Roast twelve minutes to the pound, basting
freely and often. Towards the last, dredge with flour,
and rub over with butter to make a brown froth. Pour
off the fat from the gravy, strain what is left; add, if
needed, a little boiling water; thicken with browned flour,
and serve in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Top and tail; skin and cook fifteen minutes in boiling
<i>fresh</i> water. Throw this off, add more from the boiling
tea-kettle; salt slightly, and boil until tender all through.
Drain, butter well, and pepper and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Select large, smooth tomatoes; cut a piece from the
top of each, and scoop out seeds and pulp. Chop fine
what you have removed; season with butter, pepper, salt
and sugar; add one-third as much bread-crumbs; work
all well together, and fill the skins with the mixture. Replace
the tops; put the rest of the stuffing between the
tomatoes when you have set them close together in a bake-dish.
Bake, covered, half an hour, in a moderate oven;
then uncover and cook ten minutes longer, or until browned
and soft.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Omelette aux Fines Herbes.</span></h3>

<p>Make this a course between soup and meat, passing
bread and butter with it.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of boiling milk.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>1 teaspoonful of corn-starch, wet with cold milk.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful chopped parsley, thyme, and sweet marjoram, mixed.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>Butter for the dish.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the yolks light, and pour upon them the hot milk.
Stir in the corn-starch, season, whip in the frothed whites,
lastly, the herbs. Have ready a nice pudding-dish, well
buttered. Set in the oven until hot; butter again, and
pour in the omelette. Bake about twelve minutes, or
until “set” in the middle, but not longer, or it will be a
leathery puff. It should be very light. Send up—instantly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberries and Cream.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Orange Cake.</span></p>

<p>Serve as directed on Monday of last week.</p>

<p>The orange cake, if made on Friday or Saturday, will
have kept perfectly well, if the cake-box—a tight one—containing
it has been set in the refrigerator. For directions
for making it please consult “<span class="smcap">Breakfast, Luncheon
and Tea</span>,” page 318.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Bones Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of beef bones, not scraped <i>too</i> clean.</li>
<li>2 lbs. of veal, ditto.</li>
<li>½ lb. salt pork, fat, for frying.</li>
<li>2 onions, sliced.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>½ cup of granulated tapioca.</li>
<li>3 quarts of water.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful walnut catsup.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>Crack the bones well, and lay upon a gridiron above
the coals until they are hot, and the bits of meat adhering
to them are frizzled. Meanwhile, fry the pork and onions
together in a frying-pan until the latter are a fine brown.
Strain out the pork and onions; put back the fat into the
pan and fry the bones five minutes. Lay the onions in
the soup-pot with the chopped herbs, then the bones.
Cover with the water and boil slowly three hours. Strain;
cool, and take off the fat. Set over the fire; season, boil
once to throw up the scum; skim, and put in the tapioca,
which should have soaked two hours in a little cold water.
Simmer until the tapioca is clear; put in the catsup, and
serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Chickens.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and stuff as for roasting. Sew each up in
thin muslin, or tarlatan, fitted closely to the shape, and
put on in plenty of boiling water, a little salt. Boil
twelve minutes to the pound (taking the heavier chicken
as the standard) if they are tender. If doubtful, take a
longer time, and cook more slowly. When done, lay
upon a heated dish, and pour over them a cupful of drawn
butter, made from the pot liquor, thickened with butter
rolled in flour, and with an egg beaten up in it with a little
chopped parsley. See “Drawn Butter, No. 3,” in
“General Receipts,” page 184.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a cup of rice soft in weak broth, made from a
cupful of the chicken pot-liquor, mixed with boiling water
and salted. Drain, and stir in a couple of beaten eggs;
a teaspoonful of butter, a mere dust of flour, pepper, and
a pinch of grated lemon-peel. Stir up in a saucepan
until thick and hot, and spread out to cool. When cold,
flour your hands; make the paste into long balls; roll
each in raw egg, then in cracker-dust, and fry carefully to
a yellow-brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus upon Toast.</span></h3>

<p>Tie the bunch of asparagus up with soft string, when
you have cut away the wood, and cook about twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
minutes in salted boiling water. Have ready some slices
of crustless toast; dip each in the asparagus-liquor; butter
well while hot and lay upon a heated dish. Drain the
asparagus, and arrange upon the toast. Pepper, salt, and
butter generously.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato and Beet Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Slice a cupful of cold boiled potatoes. Chop a red
beet, also boiled, but lukewarm, and pour over it four
tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Let it stand while you rub
together a teaspoonful of salt, half as much each of pepper,
sugar and made mustard, with a full tablespoonful of
oil, and a very little green pickle, minced fine. When this
is ready, take out a tablespoonful of chopped beet, and
strew among the sliced potatoes. Put them into a salad-bowl.
Squeeze beets and vinegar through muslin into
oil, etc. Beat up well, and pour over the cold potatoes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raspberry Shortcake—Hot.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of flour.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of lard, and the same of butter, chopped up in the salted flour.</li>
<li>2½ cups “loppered” milk, or of buttermilk.</li>
<li>Yolks of 2 eggs, well beaten.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of soda, sifted <i>three times</i> through the flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>1 quart “black caps” or wild raspberries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make these ingredients into a soft paste. Roll lightly
into two sheets—that intended for the upper crust half an
inch thick, the lower, less. Lay the bottom crust in a
greased square pan. Strew thickly with the berries,
sprinkle with sugar, and cover with the upper crust.
Bake about twenty-five minutes, until browned, but not
dry. Cut in squares, and send, piled upon a flat dish, to
table. Split and eat with butter and sugar. It is good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Panada Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>The liquor in which your chickens were boiled yesterday.</li>
<li>1 large cup of minced cold chicken, <i>very</i> fine.</li>
<li>½ cup fine crumbs.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs stirred into a cup of boiling milk.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and a pinch of mace.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take the fat from the cold “stock.” Heat the latter
to boiling and add the chicken, minced as finely as it can
be cut. Pepper and salt to taste, and simmer one hour.
Make ready your hot milk, at the end of that time, pour
upon the beaten eggs; stir over the fire two minutes and
add the butter, and when this is melted, the crumbs. Take
at once from the fire; put into the tureen and pour in the
soup through a colander, rubbing into it all the meat that
will pass the holes. Stir well, and serve. This soup is
very nice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Mutton Chops.</span></h3>

<p>Trim off all the fat and skin, and lard closely with strips
of fat salt pork. Pepper, and put into a hot frying-pan.
Fry them in the lardoon fat as it flows out in heating, and
turn several times to cook both sides equally. Arrange
upon a hot dish, one overlapping the next.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Pea Cakes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 cups of green peas, mashed while hot, with butter, pepper, and salt.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>Half a cupful (a small cup) of prepared flour.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>When the peas are cold beat in the eggs, milk, and, at
last, the flour. The batter should not be thick. Fry as
you would griddle-cakes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pour boiling water over them to loosen the skins. When
peeled, cut up small, leaving out the unripe and hard parts.
Put over the fire with pepper, salt, and sugar to taste; at
the end of twenty minutes’ stewing add a good piece of
butter, and simmer ten minutes more.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off the stem and blossom ends; “string” with a
sharp knife. Cut into short pieces and cook tender in
boiling salted water. Drain, pepper, salt, and butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberry Trifle.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>5 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately.</li>
<li>1 stale sponge-cake.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 cup of sweet cream.</li>
<li>Ripe strawberries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk; beat in yolks and sugar. Cook and
stir until the custard begins to thicken. Slice your cake,
and put a layer in a glass dish. Wet with the cream;
cover with fresh, ripe berries, sprinkled with sugar, then
more cake, cream, and berries, until the dish is three-quarters
full. Pour the custard, gradually, over all. Beat
the whites stiff with a little sugar and strawberry-juice, and
heap roundly on the top. Lay rows of bright berries upon
the <i>méringue</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Purée of Potatoes.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>8 large potatoes, peeled, boiled, and rubbed through a colander.</li>
<li>2 quarts of boiling water.</li>
<li>1 cup of hot milk.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of butter, rubbed in flour.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, with salt and pepper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pour the water upon the potato, season with pepper and
salt, and boil gently one hour, taking care that it does not
burn. Then stir in the butter, and when this is melted,
the hot milk. Let it begin to boil, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmon Scallops.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1½ lbs. of cold salmon, left from steaks, or a can of preserved salmon.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>½ cup good drawn butter.</li>
<li>½ cup bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and minced parsley.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the fish fine; rub the butter and seasoning into
it, and stir into the hot, drawn butter. Butter scallop-shells,
or paté-pans, fill with the mixture, and strew it with
fine crumbs. Bake a few minutes in a quick oven to
brown them lightly. Serve in the shells.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricassee of Sweetbreads.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 fine sweetbreads.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of cream.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>1 great spoonful of butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley.</li>
<li>A pinch of nutmeg.</li>
<li>1 cup of gravy—a cup of yesterday’s soup, strained, will do.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash the sweetbreads; boil five minutes; then lay in
ice-cold water. Slice and cover them with the gravy, and
stew three-quarters of an hour. Heat the cream—or milk—in
another saucepan, putting in a pinch of soda. Pour
upon the eggs, and returning these to the fire, cook one
minute. Stir in the butter and the parsley. Take both
saucepans from the fire and empty one into the other.
Stir all together well, and pour into a hot deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>See receipt for last Monday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roasted Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Wash fair-sized potatoes and bake on the oven floor
until soft to the grasp of thumb and forefinger. Wipe and

<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Cherry Dumplings.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart prepared flour.</li>
<li>2 heaping tablespoonfuls of lard.</li>
<li>2 cups fresh milk.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
<li>2 cups of stoned cherries.</li>
<li>½ cupful of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub the lard into the salted flour, wet up with the milk;
roll into a sheet a quarter of an inch thick; and cut into
squares about four inches across. Put two great spoonfuls
of cherries in the centre of each; sugar them; turn
up the edges of the paste and pinch them together. Lay
the joined edges downward, upon a floured baking-pan,
and bake half an hour or until browned. Eat hot with a
good sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ox-head Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 well cleaned ox-head.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>1 carrot.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful mixed allspice and mace.</li>
<li>6 quarts cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash the head in three waters; break the bones with a
few smart blows of a hammer. Put it on in the cold
water; bring to a slow boil and skim well. Then add the
sliced vegetables, and stew gently three hours. The liquor
should be reduced to four quarts. Take out the head and
set in the open air to cool. Strain the liquor, rubbing the
vegetables to a pulp. Return half of it to the fire—season
and skim as it boils, for five minutes; then add three-fourths
of the meat from the head, cut into dice. Simmer half an
hour, and serve. Put bones and the rest of the meat, well
seasoned, into a jar; season the reserved “stock,” and
pour it in, and keep in the refrigerator until to-morrow.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corned Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in plenty of hot water, fifteen minutes—at least—to
the pound. Serve drawn butter (made from the pot-liquor),
with chopped cucumber-pickle stirred in it, in a
sauce-boat. Save the liquor and set in a cool place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil tender in hot salted water. Drain, mash and

<h3><span class="smcap">Rice and Tapioca Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from your stock; pour it from the bones
and meat, and heat slowly. Have ready a cup of boiled
rice—hot—and half a cup of granulated tapioca, which
has been soaked two hours in a little cold water. When
the soup boils, put them in, and simmer gently half an
hour. Should it be too thick, add a little boiling water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Smothered Chicken.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and split a pair of young chickens down the
back as for broiling. Lay them in a dripping-pan; dash a
cup of boiling water, in which have been stirred two tablespoonfuls
of butter, over them, and, covering with another
pan, cook until tender, and of an equal yellow-brownish
tint all over. Lift the pan, now and then, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
baste freely—four times with the gravy—twice, toward
the last, with melted butter. Lay the chickens in a hot-water
dish; add pepper, salt, a chopped boiled egg,
<i>finely</i> minced, and a little minced parsley, with browned
flour, to the gravy. Boil up, and pour half over the
chicken, the rest into a gravy-boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Peel, seed, and slice fresh summer squashes. Lay in
cold water ten minutes; put into boiling water, a little
salt, and cook tender. Twenty minutes will suffice if the
squash be young. Mash in a colander, pressing out all
the water; heap in a deep dish, seasoning with pepper,
salt and butter. Serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>See Thursday of Second Week in this month.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beets Sautés.</span></h3>

<p>Boil young sweet beets until nearly done—say forty-five
minutes. Skin and slice them. Have ready in a
saucepan two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one tablespoonful
of vinegar, a <i>small</i> onion minced, salt and pepper.
When this begins to simmer, put in the beets, and cook
ten minutes, shaking the saucepan frequently, to prevent
scorching. Put the beets into a root-dish, and pour the
dressing upon them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>1 cup of hot boiled rice well cooked, but not broken.</li>
<li>1 cupful of sugar.</li>
<li>1 heaping tablespoonful of corn-starch.</li>
<li>5 eggs.</li>
<li>¼ teaspoonful of cinnamon and the same of grated lemon peel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk, stir in the corn-starch wet up with cold
milk; then the beaten yolks and sugar. Add to these
the heaping cup of boiled rice. Stir until it begins to
thicken, add the seasoning, and pour into a buttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
bake-dish. Bake until well “set”; spread with a <i>méringue</i>
of the whites and a little sugar, made very stiff. When this
has colored lightly, take from the oven.</p>

<p>Make on Saturday, and set on ice until Sunday. The
colder it is, the better.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Green Pea Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the top of the corned-beef liquor; add
the beef-bones and any others you may have. Boil gently
one hour, skimming often. Strain, and put in two quarts of
green peas, a minced onion, and a bunch of sweet herbs.
Cook forty-five minutes and rub to a pulp through a colander.
Add pepper, heat to a boil and pour upon dice
of fried bread laid in the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Miroton.</span></h3>

<p>Mince the remains of your corned beef; season with
pepper, salt, a little chopped pickle, two boiled eggs
chopped fine; wet with whatever gravy you may have,
and put into a greased pudding-dish. Cover with mashed
potatoes, made <i>very</i> soft with milk and butter, sift bread-crumbs
over all, and bake, covered, half an hour, then
brown. This is a nice way of warming over cold meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Asparagus Omelette.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 eggs beaten very light.</li>
<li>1 bunch of asparagus, the green tops only. (The stalks will be an improvement to your soup.)</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of milk.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>Beat whites and yolks together, add the milk, then the
boiled asparagus heads, <i>cold</i> and chopped fine. Have
ready a frying-pan with a tablespoonful of butter in it, hot,
but not frying. Pour in the mixture; shake well from
the bottom as it forms, loosen from the pan with “spatula”
or cake-turner; fold over in the middle, and turn
the pan upside down upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and slice your tomatoes, put into a salad-dish,
and pour over them a dressing prepared as follows:</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 yolks of hard-boiled eggs, pounded.</li>
<li>1 beaten raw egg.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>A pinch of cayenne.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful white sugar.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of salad oil.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of made mustard.</li>
<li>½ teacupful of vinegar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub yolks, mustard, pepper, salt, sugar and oil to a
paste. Beat in the raw egg with your whisk, finally, the
oil, a little at a time. Stir a great lump of ice into the
dressing, whirling rapidly for half a minute. Take it out
and pour the mixture over the salad.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>For Green Peas Receipt, see Sunday of First Week in

<h3><span class="smcap">Mountain Custard, or “Junket.”</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 quarts of milk.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>Vanilla, or other essence.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of liquid rennet—to be had at most of the grocers and all the druggists.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pour the milk, slightly warmed, into a glass bowl;
sweeten, flavor, and stir in the rennet. Set in a rather
warm place until it is firm, like “loppered” milk or blanc-mange;
then put on ice. If at the end of an hour it
remains liquid, put in more rennet. Do not let it stand
until the whey separates from the curd. Two hours in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
warm weather should be enough. Eat with cream and
sugar.</p>

<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>6 large tomatoes.</li>
<li>Bunch of herbs.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and 1 tablespoonful mushroom catsup.</li>
<li>¼ lb. vermicelli, broken small.</li>
<li>6 quarts of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put meat, bones, and sliced vegetables and herbs on in
the water early in the day, and stew gently five hours.
Strain and season. Set aside two quarts of stock, with the
bones and meat, highly seasoned, until to-morrow, keeping
upon the ice. Boil and skim the rest; add the vermicelli;
simmer fifteen minutes, and pour out. Put in
the catsup after the soup goes into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak.</span></h3>

<p>Flatten with the broad side of a hatchet, and broil
quickly about ten minutes over a clear, hot fire. Lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
between two hot dishes, with salt, pepper, and a great
lump of butter upon it to draw the juices to the surface,
for five minutes before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Young Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off stems and tops, skin and cook them in plenty
of boiling water for fifteen minutes. Have ready another
saucepan with a large spoonful of butter melted in it,
but not hissing hot. Put in the onions, with a little
chopped parsley, and let them warm slowly ten minutes.
Then add a cup of milk in which have been stirred salt,
pepper, and half a teaspoonful of corn-starch. Simmer
all for three minutes, stirring several times, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in hot, salted water twenty minutes. Drain well,
and chop fine. Put into a saucepan with a good spoonful
of butter, a little sugar, salt and pepper, a dust of
nutmeg, and a few teaspoonfuls of milk, and <i>beat</i> until all
resolve themselves into a smooth, soft paste.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Puffs.</span></h3>

<p>Mash and whip the potatoes very light with milk, butter,
salt and pepper; lastly, the frothed white of an egg.
Pile irregularly within a bake-dish, and set in the oven
until light and delicately browned. Glaze with butter
before taking it from the oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strawberries and Cream.</span></h3>

<p>Cap, but do not wash the berries. Never put berries
that need washing upon the table as an uncooked dessert.
Pile in a glass bowl, and pass sugar and cream with them.</p>

<li>1 cup small string-beans.</li>
<li>6 tomatoes.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>

</ul>

<p>Cook ten minutes in salted boiling water, leaving out
the tomatoes. Drain away the water, and spread the vegetables
upon a dish to cool, while you take the fat from
your cold soup-stock; strain the latter from the bones and
meat, and heat to a gentle boil. Continue this for five
minutes, skimming well; put in the parboiled vegetables,
the tomatoes, and a pint of green peas, and stew steadily,
but not fast, for half an hour. Pour out all together.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lamb Cutlets.</span></h3>

<p>Trim carefully, lay in a little warmed butter for an hour,
turning several times. Then broil upon a greased gridiron,
taking care they do not drip. Butter, pepper, and salt
each, and lay them in a circle about the peas purée.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Purée of Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Boil three pints of green peas until soft. Rub them,
while hot, through a fine colander. Work in a tablespoonful
of butter, cut up in flour; pepper and salt to taste;
add three teaspoonfuls of milk, and stir in a saucepan until
very hot and smooth. Put in the centre of a hot, flat

<h3><span class="smcap">Jelly Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 calf’s feet, well cleaned.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>2 lbs. of lean veal, cut from the knuckles.</li>
<li>1 onion stuck with three cloves.</li>
<li>Teaspoonful of celery essence.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>1 blade of mace.</li>
<li>Juice of half a lemon.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>5 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>½ cup of German sago.</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil the feet, onion, herbs, and the veal, cut into strips,
in the water for four hours, diminishing the liquid to three
quarts. Strain, and cool. Put two of the feet and the
veal back into one quart of the broth; season, and set by
on the ice. Take the fat from the rest; put the liquor,
seasoned, over the fire, boil gently and skim, add the sago,
previously soaked two hours in a cup of cold water, simmer
tender, and pour out. You can, if you like, add a
glass of pale sherry.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Sheep’s Tongues.</span></h3>

<p>Speak for six sheep’s tongues several days before you
want them, unless you have access to a large market.
Wash well in several waters. Boil in hot, salted water
half an hour, to loosen the skins. Take these off and
trim neatly. Put a cupful of your soup—before adding
the tapioca—into a saucepan, with a quarter-pound of
sliced salt pork, a teaspoonful of chopped onion, pepper,
and a lump of white sugar. Lay in the tongues, sliced
lengthwise, and stew half an hour. Lay the slices in rows,
overlapping one another, upon a hot dish; thicken the
gravy with browned flour, add the juice of a lemon, boil
once, and pour upon the tongues.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Louise.</span></h3>

<p>Mash the potatoes, and whip with a fork to a light
cream, adding milk and butter, salt and pepper. Heap
upon a shallow pie-plate, well greased, and set in the
oven until a white crust has gathered over it. Then,
wash the mound well with beaten egg. Set in a moderate
oven long enough to harden this, but not until the
yellow changes to brown. Slip, without breaking, to
another dish, by the help of the spatula.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Halibut Chowder.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of halibut, freed from bones, and cut into strips two inches long.</li>
<li>6 parboiled potatoes, sliced.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>1 good-sized onion, sliced.</li>
<li>Chopped parsley.</li>
<li>3 tablespoonfuls of butter, rolled in flour, with butter for 6 Boston crackers, split.</li>
<li>Enough boiling water to cover fish and potatoes.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put a layer of fish in the bottom of a pot; season, and
sprinkle with parsley. Hide this with sliced potato.
More fish, and yet more potatoes, until all are in, when
cover with boiling water. Put on the lid, and simmer
half an hour after the boil recommences. Have ready
the hot milk in another saucepan; stir in the floured butter.
Dip the crackers in boiling water, butter and salt
them, and line the bottom of your tureen with them.
Pour in the boiling milk; then the fish and potatoes.
Send around sliced lemon with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Pot-pie, with Dumplings.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and cut up the chicken as for fricassee. Put
a good layer of salt pork in the bottom of a broad, not
too deep pot; then a small onion, sliced, the chicken,
peppered, and enough cold water to cover it well. Over
this lay a thick sheet of good “family” pie-crust.
Stew one hour and a half; then brown the crust by putting
a red-hot stove-cover on the top of the pot. Take
off the crust with care, and set by. Take out the chicken
and arrange upon a hot-water dish. If the gravy has
boiled down too low, add a little hot water. Drop in
while the liquor is boiling hot, squares or rounds of raw
pie-paste; cook ten minutes, and lay upon the chicken.
Stir into the gravy a large spoonful of butter rolled in
flour; boil up, and pour upon the dumplings and chicken.
Lay the crust on top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sea-Kale.</span></h3>

<p>Boil fifteen minutes in hot, salted water. Drain well,
and return to the fire, with a spoonful of butter, pepper,
salt, and a little lemon-juice. Stir, or toss, five minutes,
and heap upon rounds of buttered toast in a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and slice large, ripe tomatoes. Chop fine a little
streaked salt pork, or ham. Butter a pudding-dish, and
cover the bottom with slices of tomato. Season with
pepper and sugar, and strew with bread-crumbs. Then
scatter chopped pork over it. Fill the dish in this order,
having crumbs at the top. Cover closely, and bake half
an hour, or until the juice bubbles up at the sides.
Brown nicely, and serve in the dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Charlotte Russe.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>A large sponge-cake.</li>
<li>1 pint of cream.</li>
<li>½ lb. of sugar, powdered.</li>
<li>Whites of 2 eggs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Line a tin mould with straight sides with slices of cake,
having the bottom in one piece, if possible. Whip the
cream in a syllabub-churn, and, with your egg-beater,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
whisk into this, gradually, the frothed whites and the
sugar, flavoring to taste. Fill the cake-lined mould with
this, cover with more slices, and set in ice for an hour or
so. Pass a knife around the inside of the mould to loosen
the cake, and invert upon a plate. Sift powdered sugar
over it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Soup.</span></h3>

<p>If your jelly-soup stock has been kept upon the ice
these two days, it is as good now as on Thursday. Take
off the fat, add a pint of boiling water to the soup, and
stew slowly for half an hour. Strain, add more seasoning,
and skim for a few minutes until quite clear in boiling.
Heat in another vessel a pint of milk; stir in a tablespoonful
of butter and the same of corn-starch wet up in
cold milk, with a little nutmeg. Pour this upon two
beaten eggs, cook one minute, and put into the tureen.
Add the boiling soup, and stir all up well. It will be wise
to put a pinch of soda in the milk before boiling.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Put on in plenty of boiling water, salted, and cook
twelve minutes to the pound. Take out, wipe carefully
with a hot, wet cloth; butter all over, and serve with a
cup of drawn butter sent up in a sauce-boat. Season the
pot-liquor, and, when cool, put upon the ice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hot Slaw.</span></h3>

<p>Shred a small white cabbage. Boil for fifteen minutes
in hot water, salted. Throw this away, and add four
tablespoonfuls of vinegar, the same quantity of your soup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>-stock,
with pepper and salt. Simmer in this ten minutes,
stirring often. Turn out into a deep dish; pour over it
half a cupful of drawn butter; set in a pan of boiling
water five or six minutes, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Buttered Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Slice cold boiled potatoes lengthwise. Put into a
saucepan a good lump of butler, with pepper and salt.
Add the potatoes as the butter melts, and shake over the
fire until they are very hot and covered with a sort of
glaze, but not browned.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Receipt given last Sunday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherry Roley-Poley.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of flour—Hecker’s prepared.</li>
<li>1 heaping tablespoonful of lard, and the same of butter.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>2 cups of milk.</li>
<li>2 cups of stoned cherries.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make a soft paste of flour, with the shortening chopped
into it, and the milk. Roll out, a quarter of an inch
thick, into an oblong sheet. Cover this with cherries;
sprinkle with sugar, and roll up closely upon the fruit.
In spreading the cherries, leave a narrow margin on both
sides of the sheet. Baste the roll up in a bag floured well
on the inside, and make a “felled” seam at the open end
to keep out the water. Fit it exactly, but not tightly, to
the shape of the pudding. Plunge into a pot of boiling
water and keep it at a steady boil for one hour and a half.
Dip the bag into cold water, rip the stitches, and turn out
upon a hot dish. Eat with hard sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton, Rice, and Tomato Broth.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the surface of the liquor in which
your mutton was boiled yesterday. Add to this broth the
bones of the cold mutton well cracked, and let them boil
slowly one hour and a half. Strain and cool to throw up
the fat; remove this, and put the soup over the fire with
one quart of ripe tomatoes, peeled and cut very fine, and
half a cup of raw rice. Stew forty minutes. Add a lump
of sugar; more pepper and salt, if needed, and a tablespoonful
of corn-starch, wet in cold water. Boil one
minute, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Glazed Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a ham on Saturday, allowing twenty minutes to
the pound, and let it get cold in the liquor. Set by then,
and, early Sunday morning, skin it carefully, and trim
away the rusty edges. Brush all over with beaten egg,
and cover with a paste of rolled cracker wet up with
milk, seasoned with pepper, and bound with beaten egg.
It should be a quarter of an inch thick. Set the ham in
the oven until this is lightly browned. Serve cold and
slice thin. Garnish with frilled paper about the shank.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Shell and lay in cold water fifteen minutes. Cook from
twenty to twenty-five minutes in boiling salted water.
Drain, put into a deep dish with a good lump of butter;
pepper and salt to taste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes au Gratin.</span></h3>

<p>Mash with milk and butter, and press firmly into a
pretty mould wet with cold water. Turn out at once;
sift fine <i>dry</i> crumbs all over the mould of potato; set in
the oven five minutes to get it quite hot again, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Shell; lay in cold water ten minutes. Boil tender in
hot, salted water. Drain this off, and add a scant cup of
hot milk; a good spoonful of butter, rolled in a very little
flour, with pepper and salt. Simmer three minutes and
pour into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Peel with a keen knife, and slice red, ripe tomatoes.
Make a dressing like that for lettuce on Wednesday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spanish Cream.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>½ box of Coxe’s Gelatine.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>Beaten yolks of 3 eggs.</li>
<li>1 small cup of sugar.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls flavoring extract—orange is very good in this cream.</li>
<li>A little soda.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak the gelatine in the milk two hours. Stir in the
soda, and heat, stirring often. When scalding hot, pour
upon the beaten yolks and sugar, and return to the farina-kettle.
Boil one minute, stirring ceaselessly. Strain
through tarlatan, and when cold, flavor and put into a
wet mould. Set on the ice until wanted, and eat with
cream and sugar. Make this, of course, on Saturday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee and Macaroons.</span></h3>

<p>Bring these on last of all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bisque of Lobster.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Meat of one boiled lobster, or a can of preserved lobster.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>1 quart of boiling water.</li>
<li>½ cup rolled cracker.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of butter.</li>
<li>Pepper (cayenne) and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pound the coral and other soft parts of the lobster to
a paste, and simmer five minutes in the boiling water;
then rub through a colander back into the water. Cut
the rest of the lobster-meat into dice, and put into a
saucepan with the cracker-crumbs. Pour the red water
over them, and heat to a boil, when add pepper, salt, and
the butter. Simmer, covered, half an hour, taking care
it does not scorch. Heat the milk, with a pinch of soda,
in another vessel, and after the lobster is in the tureen,
pour this in, boiling hot. Pass sliced lemon with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Good “Pick-up” Dish.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 lbs. of calf s liver, boiled and cold.</li>
<li>1 lb. cold cooked ham.</li>
<li>A cup of gravy, saved from yesterday’s soup, and strained.</li>
<li>½ cup bread-crumbs.</li>
<li>3 eggs, beaten light.</li>
<li>Parsley.</li>
<li>A very little minced onion, with pepper and a little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop liver and ham; wet with the gravy; mix in seasoning
and crumbs, and beat the eggs in. Put the mixture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
into a well-greased mould; cover this and put into a
dripping-pan full of boiling water. Cook thus one hour
and a half, keeping plenty of water in the pan, and at a
steady boil. Turn out upon a dish; pour a cup of
drawn butter over it, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Potato Balls.</span></h3>

<p>Rub cold mashed potato, left from yesterday, smooth
with a spoonful of warmed butter, and soft with warmed
milk. Beat up an egg in it, and stir, until hot, in a clean,
greased frying-pan, not allowing it to “catch” on the
side. Then let it cool. When cold and stiff, make into
balls, roll these in flour, and bake upon a greased pan
until well browned. Pile upon a hot dish.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bread-and-Cheese Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. lean veal, cut into dice.</li>
<li>A ham bone, cracked.</li>
<li>1 sliced onion.</li>
<li>1 cup of milk.</li>
<li>2 beaten eggs.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>1 cupful fried bread-dice.</li>
<li>¼ lb. dry cheese, grated.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>Chopped parsley.</li>
<li>3 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of corn-flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put meat, bone, onion, and water together, and cook
slowly four hours. Strain, pressing hard, cool, and take
off the fat. Season, and heat to a boil; put in the parsley
and corn-starch—the latter wet with cold water—and
simmer five minutes. Heat the milk in a farina-kettle,
pour upon the eggs, and re-heat, stirring constantly until
they begin to thicken. Put bread-dice and cheese into
the tureen; pour on the milk and eggs; then the hot
soup. Stir up and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breast of Lamb with Macaroni.</span></h3>

<p>Cover the bottom of a broad pot with <i>very</i> thin slices of
fat salt pork or ham. Lay the lamb upon them. Take
all the peel from a small lemon, and slice it, also
very thin. Cover the lamb with this; then with more
sliced pork. Mince a small onion and a bunch of sweet
herbs, and scatter over these. Pour in a pint of boiling
water. Put on a close lid with a weight on top, and cook
very slowly two hours, turning the meat over at the end
of the first hour. Meantime, boil half a pound of macaroni,
broken into short pieces, twenty minutes in a little
broth, borrowed from your soup; drain, pepper and salt,
and arrange into a flat bed, upon a hot meat-dish. Keep
hot until the lamb is done, when lay it upon the prepared
mound, and set both in the oven while you strain the
gravy. Thicken it with a little browned flour, and boil
up once. Pour over the lamb and macaroni.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Whole Baked Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Chop fine a half cupful of the veal left after straining
off the soup. Add half as much chopped ham, and one-third
the quantity of bread-crumbs. Pepper (and salt, if
needed). Put a few spoonfuls of gravy into a saucepan;
stir in this force-meat, with a very little onion, and the pulp
and seeds you have scraped carefully from six or eight
fine smooth tomatoes. When all are smoking hot, add a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
tablespoonful of butter, and when this has melted, take
from the fire. Set the tomatoes you have hollowed out
in a pudding-dish. Fill with the mixture; cover with the
neat slices you took from the tops; fill the interstices
with what remains of the force-meat, and bake nearly an
hour, or until soft and brown. Keep the dish covered
for the first half hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Peas and French Beans.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of shelled green peas.</li>
<li>1 pint of string-beans, carefully trimmed.</li>
<li>1 small onion, sliced thin.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter rolled in flour.</li>
<li>Pepper, salt, and a tablespoonful of tomato catsup.</li>
<li>1 pint of boiling water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cover peas, beans, and onion with salted boiling water.
Put on the saucepan lid, and stew for half an hour. Then
stir in the floured butter, pepper, and catsup; cover
again, and simmer fifteen minutes. Turn out into a deep
dish. The beans should be young, and cut into small
pieces.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Bread Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>2 heaping cups of white Indian meal.</li>
<li>1 heaping cup of flour.</li>
<li>3 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>2½ cups of milk.</li>
<li>1 large tablespoonful of melted butter, and twice as much white sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of soda, and two of cream of tartar, sifted <i>twice</i> through the flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful mingled mace and cinnamon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub butter and sugar together; beat in the yolks; then
the milk; the spice; the salted meal, previously mixed
with the flour, cream of tartar, and soda. Beat <i>hard</i> for
five minutes. Pour into a buttered mould, with a top. Set
in a pot of boiling water—the water not quite reaching
the top—and boil steadily two hours. Turn out, cut in
slices, and eat with butter and sugar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Stew Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of lean beef.</li>
<li>1 lb. of lean ham.</li>
<li>2 lbs. of lean veal.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>

<li>2 blades of mace.</li>
<li>½ cup Scotch barley.</li>
<li>6 quarts of water.</li>
<li>4 tablespoonfuls good dripping—beef or ham.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat into strips, and slice the vegetables. Put
the dripping into the soup-pot; next the beef; then a
layer of vegetables; next one of ham; more vegetables,
the veal, the rest of the vegetables, and a cup of cold
water. Cover, and heat very slowly, then stew until the
meat is covered with a brown glaze, but not burned. Be
very careful on this latter point. Now, pour in your six
quarts of water, and cook steadily <i>at least</i> three hours.
Strain, take out the scraps of meat, and pulp the vegetables
into the soup. Take out two quarts of stock, season,
and put by, with the meat in it, for to-morrow. Let
the rest cool; take off the fat; season, boil up and skim,
and put in the barley, already soaked two hours in a little

<p>Wash and soak the heart ten minutes in cold, salt
water. Fill <i>full</i> with a force-meat of fat salt pork, minced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
fine with an equal weight of bread-crumbs, a little chopped
parsley, with pepper, and a small quantity of grated lemon-peel.
Sew up the swollen heart trimly in coarse net or
tarlatan, and put on in a saucepan with two cups of weak
broth, made by taking a cupful from the soup and diluting
it with water, and half a minced onion. Boil two hours,
turning twice. Keep closely covered. Make ready a
cup of drawn butter, and let it get almost cold. Then
whip in the frothed whites of two eggs, and when stiff, two
tablespoonfuls of grated horseradish. You can buy it in
any market. Add the juice of a lemon, unless your horseradish
is put up in vinegar. The mixture should look like
whipped cream. Put into a sauce-boat. When your
heart is done, remove the cloth, and lay upon a hot dish.
Strain the gravy; thicken with browned flour, and pour
over the heart. Pass the white sauce with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Boil and mash the squash in the customary way, and
let it cool. Beat the yolks of the two eggs, the whites of
which were used for the horseradish sauce, and when the
squash is nearly cold, whip these into it, with three tablespoonfuls
of milk, one of butter, rolled in flour and melted
in the milk; pepper and salt to taste. Pour into a buttered
bake-dish, cover with fine crumbs, and bake to a light
brown in a quick oven. Eat hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beets.</span></h3>

<p>Wash and cut off the tops. Boil more than an hour if
they are of a fair size. Scrape, slice, and lay in a dish.
Pour over them a tablespoonful of butter, heated with one
of vinegar, and seasoned with salt and pepper. If any
are left over, save them for salad, by pouring vinegar
upon them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">New Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Rub the skins off, and cook until tender in boiling

Sweeten abundantly, and set by to cool. When cold,
pour into a pie-dish lined with puff-paste, cover with a
top crust, and bake in a good oven. Eat cold, but fresh,
with powdered sugar sifted over the top.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">String-Bean Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Boil three cups of string-beans—rid of all the fibres
and cut small—in hot salted water until very tender.
Drain and chop them, rub them through a colander to a
pulp. Take the fat from the stock kept in the ice-box
since yesterday; pour off from the meat, and strain into
a soup pot. Bring to a boil; skim, and stir in the beans,
with a great spoonful of butter cut up in as much flour.
Simmer fifteen minutes; add seasoning, if necessary, and
pour upon dice of fried bread in the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breaded Mutton Chops.</span></h3>

<p>Trim the chops well, leaving an inch of bare bone at
the small end of each. Dip in beaten egg, then in rolled
cracker, and fry in hot lard or dripping. Drain, and
stand upon the large ends in a row about the base of
your hillock of potatoes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes with Onion.</span></h3>

<p>Loosen the tomato-skins with boiling water. Peel and
slice them, and put into a saucepan with a sliced onion,
a good piece of butter, pepper, salt, and a little sugar.
Stew gently half an hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Corn Boiled Whole.</span></h3>

<p>Strip off the outer husks; turn down the innermost
covering, and pull off the silk with great care. Re-cover
the ear with the thin inner husk; tie at the top with a bit
of thread, and cook in salted boiling water from twenty-five
to thirty minutes. Cut off the stalks close to the
cob, and send the corn to the table wrapped in a napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash, and mould into a shapely hillock, fenced about
with a <i>chevaux de frise</i> of chops.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherries.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, handling gingerly, and heap about a lump of ice
in a glass bowl.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raspberries and Cream, with Light Cakes.</span></h3>

<p>Do not sugar the berries in the dish, but pass sugar and
cream with each saucerful.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Convent Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 potatoes.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>1 pint of green peas.</li>
<li>1 cup of string-beans, cut into short lengths.</li>
<li>¼ of a small cabbage.</li>
<li>6 tomatoes, peeled and sliced.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>½ cup of good dripping.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of flour.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter, rolled in flour.</li>
<li>2 qts. and 1 pint of boiling water.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Parboil, and leave to cool, turnips, carrots, and potatoes,
sliced; also the chopped cabbage. Slice the onions,
and fry in the hot dripping for five minutes. Then stir
in the flour, and simmer until well colored. Turn into a
soup-kettle the contents of the frying-pan, rinsing out the
latter with two cups of boiling water, and pour this, also,
into the soup-pot. When it bubbles, add all the vegetables.
Stir a few minutes, and put in another pint of hot
water. Cover, and simmer until all are heated through
and begin to boil, when put in the rest of the water.
Cook slowly for two hours, or until all are soft and breaking.
Strain, and pulp the vegetables through the colander.
Season the <i>purée</i> with salt, pepper, and sweet
herbs, chopped; stir in your floured butter; simmer five
minutes, stirring well, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Salmon.</span></h3>

<p>The middle slice of salmon is the best. Sew up neatly
in a mosquito-net bag, and boil a quarter of an hour to
the pound in hot, salted water. When done, unwrap
with care, and lay upon a hot dish, taking care not to
break it. Have ready a large cupful of drawn butter,
very rich, in which has been stirred a tablespoonful of
minced parsley and the juice of a lemon. Pour half
upon the salmon, and serve the rest in a boat. Garnish
with parsley and sliced eggs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Chicken—Whole.</span></h3>

<p>Truss a young, tender chicken as for roasting, but do
not stuff it. Put into a steamer, or cover closely in a
colander, over a pot of fast-boiling water for half an hour.
Have ready some very nice dripping, or a mixture of one-third
butter, two-thirds lard, in a deep frying or saucepan.
Flour the chicken all over, and put in when the fat is hot.
When the lower side is of a fine brown, turn the fowl.
When both are cooked, take it out, lay a few slices of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
onion in the bottom of a tin pail, and put in the chicken.
Fit on the top, and set in a pot of water, which must be
kept at a slow boil, half an hour. Rub the chicken well
with melted butter, in which have been stirred pepper,
salt, and chopped parsley, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Onions.</span></h3>

<p>See Tuesday of Third Week in this month.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>See Sunday of this week.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Duchesse.</span></h3>

<p>Cut cold mashed potatoes, round or square, with a
cake-cutter; flour well, and bake in the oven, buttering
as they begin to brown. If the potatoes are too pliable
to cut out well, mould by pressing firmly into your cutter,
which should first be wet with cold water. Serve with
the salmon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherry Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Line a pie-dish with cold crust; fill with whole cherries—tart
and sweet, in equal proportions; sugar plentifully;
put on a top crust, and bake in a tolerably brisk
oven. Eat cold, with powdered sugar sifted over the top.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gravy Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 lbs. of lean beef.</li>
<li>1 lb. of ham.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>1 carrot.</li>
<li>1 turnip.</li>
<li>6 tomatoes.</li>
<li>Bunch of herbs.</li>

<li>2 teaspoonfuls of celery essence.</li>
<li>1 cucumber.</li>
<li>2 onions.</li>
<li>6 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>Toasted bread cut into dice.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful walnut catsup.</li>
<li>Dripping for frying.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the meat into strips; pare and slice the vegetables.
Fry the onions brown in dripping. Put all together into
the soup-kettle, with one quart of cold water, and bring
<i>slowly</i> to a boil. Then pour in a quart of hot water.
Cook an hour longer—still slowly—and pour in the rest
of the water—<i>cold</i>. Boil steadily three hours after the
bubbling recommences. The meat should be done to
rags, the vegetables broken to pieces. Strain, pulping
the vegetables through a colander; then strain a second
time through a soup-sieve, or squeeze through a double
tarlatan or mosquito-net bag. Season the soup, and set
aside your Sunday portion, seasoning the rags of meat
highly, and returning them to it. (Keep on the ice.)
Put to-day’s soup back into the pot; boil and skim; add
a tablespoonful of walnut catsup and pour upon dice of
well-buttered toast, laid in the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Veal.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>3 lbs. of raw, lean veal, chopped fine.</li>
<li>½ lb. of fat salt pork, also minced.</li>
<li>1 small onion, minced.</li>
<li>A pinch of lemon peel.</li>
<li>2 lemons peeled and sliced.</li>
<li>3 eggs beaten light.</li>
<li>1 cup well-seasoned and strained tomato sauce.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>Rolled cracker.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work meat, eggs, onion and seasoning up soft with the
tomato-sauce, and stir in enough cracker to enable you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
to mould it with your hands. Press firmly into a wet
bowl, and invert upon a pie-dish, withdrawing the bowl
cautiously. Now, sift cracker-dust thickly all over it, and
cover the top and half-way down the sides with thin slices
of lemon. Bake one hour in a good oven; pick off the
lemon with care and dispatch, and brown nicely on the
upper grating of the oven. Serve in the pie-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, slice, lay in cold water fifteen minutes. Cook
tender in boiling water, salted, drain well, and mash with
pepper, salt and butter, pressing out all the water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>See Receipt for Monday of this week.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Cucumbers.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and lay them in ice-water one hour, then slice and
season to taste with vinegar, pepper and salt. Never omit
the soaking in ice-water.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bananas and Oranges.</span></h3>

<p>Serve in the same fruit-basket or dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherries.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clear Sago Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Remove the fat from the surface of your cold “stock,”
pour off without disturbing the sediment, and heat to a
boil. Skim as long as the scum rises; then stir in the
beaten white of an egg, and simmer, skimming well until
it has brought up with it all the impurities, leaving the
soup clear. Add half a cup of German sago, previously
soaked two hours in a little water, and cook gently until
this is melted; then serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Shoulder of Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Cut half a pound of salt fat pork into narrow, long lardoons.
Roll them in a mixture of pepper, allspice and
vinegar. If you have no larding-needle, make incisions
in the shoulder of mutton with a thin, narrow-bladed knife,
and thrust in the strips of pork, leaving about a quarter
of an inch projecting on the upper side. Put into a dripping-pan,
pour two cupfuls of boiling water over it, in
which has been mixed a glass of claret. Cover with another
pan, and cook two hours, if the shoulder be of full size.
Baste frequently—for an hour and a half with its own gravy—then
three times with a mixture of melted butter and currant
jelly, leaving off the upper pan that the meat may
brown. Dish the meat; thicken the strained gravy with
browned flour, and after one boil, serve in a boat. To
save labor and time on Sunday, lard the meat over night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Skin and slice. Cover the bottom of a pie-dish (buttered)
with dry crumbs; lay tomatoes over them. Season
with pepper, salt, sugar and butter. Put alternate layers
of crumbs and seasoned tomatoes until the dish is full,
having crumbs on top. Bake, covered, half an hour, and
brown slightly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Corn.</span></h3>

<p>Please see Thursday, Fourth Week in June.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">New Potatoes—Stewed.</span></h3>

<p>Rub or scrape off the skins; boil in hot salted water
until done. Turn off the water and dry out on the range.
Then crack each one by steady pressure with the back
of a spoon, and drop into a saucepan containing a cup
of hot milk, pepper, salt, chopped parsley, and a great
spoonful of butter cut up in flour. Simmer five minutes,
and pour into a vegetable dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raspberry and Currant Jelly with Whipped
Cream.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of red currants and the same of red raspberries.</li>
<li>2 cups of white sugar.</li>
<li>1 package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in one cup of cold water.</li>
<li>1 cup of boiling water.</li>
<li>1 pint of whipped cream.</li>
</ul>

<p>Crush the fruit and strain out every drop of juice
through coarse muslin. Stir sugar, soaked gelatine, and
boiling water together. When clear, strain into the fruit
juice. Strain again through a flannel bag. Pour into
a wet mould that has a cylinder in the centre. Do this
on Saturday, and bury in the ice. On Sunday, turn out
into a glass dish, fill the open centre with whipped cream,
and pile more about the base.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Jugged Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Early in the day put on the cracked bones from which
you have cut the cold mutton, with refuse bits of skin,
crisped meat, etc., into a soup-pot with three quarts of
water, and boil at the back of the range down to two
quarts. Strain; let the liquid cool to throw up the fat,
and remove this. Have ready in a stone jar, with a top,
six parboiled potatoes, sliced, laid upon slices of streaked
pork, cut <i>very</i> thin; upon this a sliced onion; next,
three sliced tomatoes; then a sliced turnip; on this a
cupful of green peas; three more tomatoes; then a quarter-cup
of raw rice; cover this with a grated carrot, and
this with another layer of sliced pork. Sprinkle a little
salt and pepper, and a few dots of butter upon each layer
of vegetables, and put upon the pork some chopped sweet
herbs. Pour the cooled broth over all; put on the jar
lid, with a paste of flour and water around the edge to exclude
the air and keep in the steam, and set in a pan of
boiling water in the oven. Leave it there as long as
possible—four hours at the least. Pour into the tureen
without further preparation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Batter Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Mince and season your cold mutton, wet it with the
remains of yesterday’s gravy and put into a bake-dish.
Mash six boiled potatoes soft with butter; beat in two
eggs; a heaping tablespoonful of prepared flour, and a
cup of milk. Mix well, and pour over the mutton. Bake
to a good brown in a moderate oven. One hour will be
needed to cook it properly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Squash.</span></h3>

<p>See Receipt for Saturday of Third Week in June.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chopped Corn and Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the corn from the cobs left cold from yesterday
and chop the cold new potatoes, also left over. Have
ready in a frying pan a large spoonful of good dripping,
well seasoned, and hot. Stir in corn and potatoes, and
toss about until hot and glazed, but not browned. Serve
in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Starch Custard Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>4 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>4 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>Nutmeg and cinnamon.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk; stir in the corn-starch wet up in cold milk,
and cook in a farina-kettle three minutes. Take from the
fire; beat in the butter, and let it cool. When cold, beat
in the eggs and sugar, with the spice. Whip two minutes,
and bake in a buttered dish until lightly browned
and well set. Eat cold, with sugar sifted over it.</p>

<li>Chopped parsley, pepper and salt.</li>
<li>Some salt-pork bones and rind, if convenient.</li>

<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak.</span></h3>

<p>See Tuesday of Third Week in June.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Top, tail, and skim. Cook fifteen minutes in boiling
water. Drain this off and throw it away. Replenish the
pot with boiling water, put in a little salt, and stew tender.
Drain, dish, season well with pepper and salt, and
butter liberally.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes—Moulded.</span></h3>

<p>Mash smooth, but not too soft, with butter and milk.
Wet a jelly-mould, fill with the potatoes, pressed in firmly.
Shake gently out upon a flat dish, set one minute in the
hot oven, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String-Beans Sautés.</span></h3>

<p>Trim, cut in short pieces, and cook tender in boiling

then add a tablespoonful of butter. While these are boiling
stir in the beans; shake and stir for three minutes,
add a teaspoonful of vinegar, and pour out.</p>

<p>When you can give an uncooked dessert, which is more
palatable and more wholesome than a cooked one, and that
costs no more, it is wise policy to avail yourself of the
consequent lightening of your labors, especially in hot
weather. Except when it is necessary to deviate from
the rule in order to secure the requisite variety, let cold
desserts be the order of the day in your bills of fare, while
the “heated term” lasts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

with a gallon of cold water, and put in beef, ham, and
herbs. Cover again, and boil gently three hours. Take
out the strips of veal, beef, and ham, when you have
strained off the water, and pulp the onion. Set aside half
the stock, highly seasoned, with the meat in it, for to-morrow.

through net or tarlatan, into a saucepan. Season well;
stir into it a great spoonful of butter rolled in flour. Simmer
five minutes; put the macaroni into a deep dish,
sprinkling grated cheese over each layer, and pour the hot
sauce over it, opening the mass with a fork, to let it reach
the lower layers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Shell, lay in cold water fifteen minutes, and cook from
twenty-five to thirty minutes in salt boiling water. Drain
well; season with pepper, salt, and butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Cucumbers.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, cut into lengthwise slices, more than a quarter of
an inch thick, and lay for half an hour in ice-water. Wipe
each piece dry; sprinkle with pepper and salt, and dredge
with flour. Fry to a light brown in good dripping or butter.
Drain well, and serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Trifle.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 large sliced sponge cake.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>5 heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful extract of lemon.</li>
<li>1 lemon—all the juice and half the rind <i>finely</i> grated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk, stir in four tablespoonfuls of sugar into
the beaten yolks and pour the hot milk upon it, by degrees,
stirring well. Return to the custard-kettle, and
stir until it begins to thicken. Flavor, and pour, quite hot,
upon the sliced cake laid in the bottom of a deep dish.
If the dish be of glass, roll it in hot water before cake and
custard go in. Put a heavy saucer on the cake to keep it
from rising, and let it cool. When perfectly cold, heap
upon it a <i>méringue</i> of the beaten whites, whipped up with
the other tablespoonful of sugar, the lemon-juice and rind.
Set on ice until wanted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Italian Paste Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from your cold soup-stock; pour off from
the sediment; boil and skim, adding a tablespoonful of
walnut or mushroom catsup. When the scum ceases to
rise, put in a quarter of a pound of Italian paste—<i>i. e.</i>,
something like macaroni cut into small figures, letters,
stars, and the like. Simmer twenty minutes and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Spanish Mackerel.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and wipe dry. Split, so that when laid flat
the backbone will be in the middle. Sprinkle with salt
and lay, inside down, upon a buttered gridiron, over a clear
fire, until it is nicely colored, then turn. When done, put
upon a hot dish, butter plentifully and pepper. Put a
hot cover over it and send to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Beef à la Mode.</span></h3>

<p>Smooth the round on the top and garnish with pickled
beets and parsley. <i>Shave</i> off horizontal slices in carving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pass with the fish, and, if you like, again when the meat
comes on.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Shell, lay in cold water fifteen minutes; cook from
twenty to twenty-five minutes in boiling salt water, adding
a lump of sugar unless they are just gathered. Drain very
well, dish, pepper, salt, and butter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and slice with a sharp knife. Lay in a glass dish
and pour over them a dressing made thus: Rub a teaspoonful
of sugar, half as much each of salt, pepper, and
made mustard, into two tablespoonfuls of oil. Beat into
this the yolk of a raw egg, and then, a few drops at a time,
five tablespoonfuls of vinegar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Raspberry Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Line a pie-dish with puff paste, and fill with raspberries,
sweetened bountifully. Cover with a paste-crust, but do not
pinch this down at the edges. Also rub the edge of the
lower crust with butter to prevent adhesion. Bake in a good
oven. While it is cooking, heat a small cup of rich milk,
putting in a pinch of soda—stir into it half a teaspoonful
of corn-starch, wet in cold milk, one tablespoonful of white
sugar, and cook three minutes. Take it off, and beat in
the frothed whites of two eggs. Whip to a cream, and let
it get cold. When the pie comes out of the oven, lift the
top crust and pour in the mixture. Replace the crust and
set aside to cool. Sift sugar upon the top before serving.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Soup without Meat.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>12 large red tomatoes, peeled and sliced.</li>
<li>1 small onion, sliced.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls nice dripping.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful chopped parsley.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter rolled in flour.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of sugar.</li>
<li>1 small cupful of hot boiled rice.</li>
<li>1 quart of boiling water.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>Fry the onion in the soup-pot in the dripping. When
they are of a reddish-brown, add the tomatoes and stir all
up until very hot, when put in the boiling water and parsley.
Stew half an hour, and strain, rubbing the tomato
through a sieve into the hot liquid. Return to the pot,
season, and when boiling again, stir in the floured butter,
and a minute later the rice. Simmer ten minutes and
pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken—Stewed Whole.</span></h3>

<p>Truss as for roasting; but do not stuff it. Put a layer
of fat salt pork in the bottom of a saucepan; then, some
sliced onion and parsley. Lay in the chicken and put in
a cupful of gravy made by boiling the feet and giblets,
and, when these are taken out, add a good spoonful of
butter to the weak broth. Cover the saucepan closely,
and stew one hour, <i>slowly</i>. Turn the fowl, and stew one
hour more, keeping it covered. Take it out of the pot;
lay upon a dish, and thicken the gravy, after straining it,
with a little browned flour. Pepper, also, to taste, and
pour over the fowl, which should be so tender as to fall
apart under the carver’s knife.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, mash, and let it get cold. Then, beat up light
with a tablespoonful of melted butter, two raw eggs; three
tablespoonfuls of milk, with pepper and salt to liking.
Put into a buttered bake-dish; sift dry crumbs over the
top, and bake in a quick oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a cup of rice soft; work into it, while hot, a tablespoonful
of butter, one of grated cheese, pepper, salt, and
a beaten egg. Spread out to cool. Chop the boiled giblets
of your chicken fine with a slice or so of your cold
beef, wet with a little gravy, but not too soft. Make the
cold rice into square, flat cakes. Lay in the centre of
each a teaspoonful of the mince. Close the cakes so as
to have this in the middle; mould into oval balls; dip in
beaten egg; then, roll in cracker-crumbs and grated
cheese, and fry in good dripping, or lard. Drain well,
and heap upon a hot dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Omelette.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>6 eggs.</li>
<li>½ cup of milk.</li>
<li>1 small cup mashed potato, seasoned with pepper and salt.</li>
<li>Butter for frying.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat yolks and whites together. Thin the potato with
the milk, and strain through a colander. Stir into the
eggs, have the butter warm in the pan, pour in the mixture;
shake, and loosen with a spatula, and when nearly
done, hold it under the red-hot grate to brown the upper
side. Invert the pan above a very hot dish, and turn out
without folding. Serve at once, as it soon falls.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherry Bread Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of milk, with a pinch of soda stirred in.</li>
<li>Loaf of stale baker’s bread, pared and sliced.</li>
<li>Butter to spread the bread.</li>
<li>4 eggs.</li>
<li>1 cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 full cup of stoned cherries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Butter the bread on both sides. Put a layer into a
buttered bake-dish; pour upon it a little raw custard,
made of the eggs, sugar, and milk. Strew over this some
of the cherries, and lay in more buttered bread. Proceed
in this order until the dish is full. The upper layer should
be bread particularly well-buttered and soaked. Cover
the dish closely; set in a dripping-pan full of boiling
water, and cook one hour; then uncover, and brown
delicately. Turn out upon a plate, and eat hot with
sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Consommé Soup.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 old chicken.</li>
<li>3 lbs. of lean beef.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>1 turnip.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>Bunch of sweet herbs.</li>
<li>7 quarts of cold water.</li>
<li>½ cup sago, soaked in cold water.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the beef into strips, and joint the chicken. Slice
the vegetables, chop the herbs, and put on all with the
water, to cook slowly for six hours. Take out the
chicken and beef; salt and pepper and put into a jar.
Strain the soup, pulping the vegetables through a colander.
Season and divide it; pouring half upon the meat
in the jar, and setting in a pot of hot water to cook, covered,
two hours more. Heat the rest, and skim; put in
the sago, and simmer for half an hour; then pour out.</p>

<p>When the two hours have elapsed, pour out the stock
into a bowl, and, when cold, put upon ice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Braised Veal.</span></h3>

<p>The breast is a good piece for this purpose. Put three
or four spoonfuls of sweet dripping in a broad saucepan,
and when hot, lay in the veal and fry on both sides.
Pour over it two cupfuls of broth, taken from your soup;
a minced onion and a couple of sliced tomatoes. Cover
and stew forty-five minutes. Take out the veal and keep
warm, while you strain and skim the gravy, and return to
the pot with pepper, salt, and minced summer savory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
also, a pinch of mace, a lump of sugar, and a pinch of
grated lemon-peel. Put back the meat, and stew half an
hour more. Lay on a dish, thicken the gravy, boil once,
and pour over the veal.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower, with Sauce.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 head of cauliflower.</li>
<li>1 cup of drawn butter.</li>
<li>Juice of a lemon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tie the cauliflower in a net and boil in hot, salted
water from thirty-five to fifty minutes, in proportion to its
size. Take up, undo the net, lay in a deep dish, blossom
upward, and pour over it a cup of rich drawn butter,
with the juice of a lemon stirred in.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Cucumbers.</span></h3>

<p>See Saturday, Fourth Week in June.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Corn Pudding.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Grated corn of 12 large ears.</li>
<li>1 quart of milk.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of sugar.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the yolks well; then add the corn, the butter and
salt, and stir up hard with your “beater.” Then comes
the milk, next the sugar; lastly, the whites. Bake in a
greased pudding-dish, covered, one hour. Then brown
well. Serve hot in the bake-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cottage Puffs.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 cup of milk and one of cream.</li>
<li>4 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of butter, rubbed into the flour.</li>
<li>A little salt.</li>
<li>4 cups of prepared flour, or enough for cake batter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix the whipped yolks with the milk and cream; then
the salt and the whites; lastly, the flour. Beat fast and
well, and bake in “gem” pans. The oven should be
quick. Eat hot, with sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Béchamel Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the jellied stock in your refrigerator;
dip it out carefully from the meat—taking care of the
chicken—and heat in a saucepan. Scald a quart of milk
in another vessel, and stir into it a large spoonful of corn-starch,
wet with cold milk. Pepper and salt to taste
(the milk should have had a pinch of soda in it), and
pour into the tureen. Add the boiling soup, stir up well,
and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>The leg is best for this purpose, and will look much
nicer when served, if it has been tied up in very coarse,
thin muslin, or in white mosquito-netting. Put on in
plenty of boiling salted water, and cook a quarter of an
hour to the pound. Unwrap when done, brush all over
with butter, and serve with a boat of drawn butter, in
which have been stirred two dozen capers or pickled
nasturtium-seed. Take care of the liquor.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Rissoles.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the chicken, boiled in your soup, from the bones,
and chop fine. Add to it a cupful of mashed potato,
whipped to a cream, a beaten egg, pepper and salt; wet
soft with a little of the soup, and heat in a frying-pan,
in which has been melted a little butter. Stir until very
hot, and let it get perfectly cold. You can see that this
is done before morning service, if you have an early dinner
on Sunday. When cold, make into bails; roll in
egg, then in cracker-crumbs, and fry to a light brown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
lard or nice dripping. Drain off the fat, and serve hot
upon a folded napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>See Monday of Fourth Week in June.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas and Raw Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>See Thursday of First Week in July.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Self-freezing Ice-Cream.</span></h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
<li>1 quart of rich milk.</li>
<li>8 beaten eggs.</li>
<li>3 pints of rich, sweet cream.</li>
<li>4 cups of sugar.</li>
<li>1 vanilla bean, broken in two, and boiled in the custard, or 5 teaspoonfuls of vanilla essence.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the milk; pour it upon the eggs and sugar. Cook,
stirring steadily fifteen minutes, or until it has thickened
well. When perfectly cold, add the cream. Make the custard
on Saturday, and set on ice. Early Sunday morning,
beat in the cream, and put all in an old-fashioned upright
freezer, set in its pail. Put a block of ice within a
stout sack, or between the folds of a piece of carpeting,
and beat <i>small</i> with a hammer. Put a thick layer into
the outer part, then one of <i>rock-salt</i>. Fill the pail in this
order, and, before covering the freezer with ice, beat the
custard for five minutes with a flat stick or ladle. Shut
tightly; pack pounded ice and salt over it, and put a folded
carpet over all. In an hour and a half, open the freezer,
first wiping off the salt from about the top. Dislodge the
frozen custard from sides and bottom with a long knife,
and beat and stir with your stick, faithfully, until the
custard is a smooth paste. Replace the cover; let off the
water, and pack more pounded ice and salt about it, completely
concealing the freezer. Put back the folded carpet.
The cream will take care of itself for three hours,
and more, and you can, if you like, leave it all day, with
a visit of three minutes every few hours, to let off the
water and pack in more salt and ice. Do not open the
freezer until you are ready for the cream. Then take it
out, wipe it off, wrap a towel wrung out in hot water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
about the lower part, and invert it upon a flat dish.
Should the weather be very hot, you may have to let off
the water oftener than once in three hours; but this seldom
happens if the freezer be set in a cool cellar.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Brown Soup.</span></h3>

<p>½ lb. lean bacon; 2 onions; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter;
1 scant teaspoonful mixed allspice and cloves; 2 tablespoonfuls
browned flour; liquor in which your mutton
was boiled; pepper.</p>

<p>Cut the bacon into strips, and slice the onions. Put
the butter into your soup-pot with these, and simmer, stirring
often, until they are browned, but not scorched.
Add the flour, wet up in cold water, and stir until very
hot. Then, having taken the fat from the top of your
mutton “pot-liquor,” pour it in, with pepper and parsley.
Add by degrees, stirring well, not to lump the flour.
Cover, and set at the back of the range to simmer for two
hours—more would not hurt it. When ready for it, strain
into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ragoût of Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Slice even, rather thick slices, without skin or fat, from
your boiled mutton, and lay in a deep dish. Pour a good
glass of claret wine over them, and cover for an hour.
Make a gravy of the bones and refuse portions with a
quart of cold water. When this has boiled down to a
pint, strain it off. Let it cool, and take off the fat. Put
into a saucepan with a little minced onion, pepper, salt,
and a tablespoonful of tomato catsup, and boil down to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
large cupful. Then stir in a tablespoonful of browned
flour, wet up in cold water; simmer three minutes; add
the sliced meat and wine, with a little grated lemon-peel
and a teaspoonful of currant jelly. Let all get hot slowly,
but the meat must <i>not</i> boil, or it will be tough. Set at
one side of the range to heat, until you are ready to pour
it into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Squash à la Crême.</span></h3>

<p>Boil and mash in the customary manner; press out all
the water, and beat in a tablespoonful of melted butter,
with two of cream, heated, pepper and salt to taste;
lastly, a beaten egg. Put the mixture into a pail, and set
in boiling water fifteen minutes, stirring often, and keeping
the water at a boil. It should look like rich custard.
Serve in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare as usual, and serve without browning.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Pick out and pull apart the hearts; pile in a glass dish;
sprinkle with sugar, and season to taste with oil, vinegar,
pepper, and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raspberries, Cream, and Cake.</span></h3>

<p>Since your soup and ragoût have taken more time and
labor than you like to give to Monday’s dinner, make up
for the loss by serving the dessert given above, sure that
nobody will murmur.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Iced Coffee.</span></h3>

<p>Make more coffee than usual at breakfast-time, and
stronger. Add one-third as much hot milk as you have
coffee, and set away. When cold, put upon ice. Serve
at dessert, with cracked ice in each tumbler.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cabbage Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 lbs. of lean beef, chopped, and the same of mutton-bones,
well cracked; 1 small, firm white cabbage; 1
onion; bunch of sweet herbs; 1 cup of milk, heated, with
a pinch of soda; 1 tablespoonful of butter, rubbed in one
of flour; pepper and salt; 3 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Cook beef, onion, and bones in the water four hours,
boiling slowly. Boil the cabbage in two waters; let it
get cold, and shred only the white parts into rather coarse
dice. Cool the soup, and take off the fat. Put over the
fire with pepper and salt and the chopped herbs. Having
boiled it one minute, skim, and put in the cabbage.
Heat the milk in a separate vessel; stir in the floured
butter; boil until it thickens, and pour into the tureen.
When the cabbage-soup reaches the boil, pour it upon
the milk, and stir up well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mock Pigeons.</span></h3>

<p>Take the bone from two nice fillets of veal; flatten
them with the broad side of a hatchet, and spread with a
good force-meat of crumbs and chopped ham, seasoned
well. Roll the meat up on this; bind into oblong rolls
with soft string; lay in a dripping-pan, and pour over
them two cups of your boiling soup before the cabbage
goes in—or any other hot broth will do as well. Turn a
pan over them and bake nearly two hours, basting well
with the gravy. When done, lay upon a hot dish, while
you thicken the gravy with browned flour, and season
well with pepper, salt, and tomato catsup. Boil one
minute, and pour part over the pigeons, the rest into a
boat. Clip the strings carefully, and do not pull them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
hard in removing them, lest you spoil the shape of the
meat.</p>

<p>1 quart fresh milk; 3 tablespoonfuls of farina, soaked
one hour in a little cold water; 3 eggs; 4 tablespoonfuls
of sugar; a little salt; flavoring essence.</p>

<p>Heat three-quarters of the milk, salt it, and stir in the
farina. Cook half an hour, stirring often; take it off, and
pour upon the eggs, sugar, and the other cup of milk,
beaten together. Return to the farina-kettle, and stir ten
minutes longer. Pour out, beat in the flavoring, and put
into a wet mould. Set on the ice, when cool. It will
soon form. Eat with cream, or fruit syrup.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Crab Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Two pounds of lean veal chopped, covered with two
quarts of cold water, boiled down one-half, strained,
cooled, skimmed and seasoned with pepper and salt.
Meat of three large crabs, boiled and cold. One pint
milk, and a pinch of soda stirred into it. Pepper, salt,
nutmeg, one teaspoonful of anchovy paste. One cup of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
boiled rice—soft and hot. Tablespoonful of floured butter.
Return the broth—prepared as directed above—to the
fire, with the rice, and simmer until the latter is broken to
pieces. Strain, rubbing the rice through the sieve; set
over the fire, adding the nutmeg and anchovy; then the
crab meat, cut into small dice. Simmer ten minutes longer—it
must not actually <i>boil</i>—and pour into the tureen.
Add the boiling milk, which has been thickened with the
floured butter; stir up well and serve. Pass sliced lemon,
crackers and butter with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Savory Calf’s Head.</span></h3>

<p>Wash the head well—it should of course have been
cleaned with the skin on; take out the tongue and brains;
boil them in a separate vessel, and keep on ice for to-morrow’s
soup. Put on the head (the two sides tied into
the original shape by a band of tape) in plenty of cold
water, slightly salt, and cook gently one hour and a half.
Take out, wipe dry, score the cheeks in squares, and
wash the head on top and sides, with beaten egg. Sift
over it a mixture of rolled cracker, pepper and salt; and
set in a quick oven. In ten minutes, baste with melted
butter; five minutes later, with a cupful of broth from the
pot poured gradually over it. Cover with thick white
paper and cook ten minutes longer, then dish, with thin
slices of crisped ham laid about it. Thicken the gravy in
the pan with browned flour, and send up in a boat. Save
the pot-liquor for soup, seasoning it, and keeping in a cold
place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Loosen the skins by pouring boiling water upon them.
Peel, slice, and put into a saucepan with a little minced
onion, pepper, salt and sugar, and stew from twenty-five
to thirty minutes. Just before taking them up, add a good
lump of butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Puff.</span></h3>

<p>Mash the potatoes very light and soft; whipping in
milk, butter, salt, and two beaten eggs. Heap within a
greased bake-dish, and set in a good oven until well
browned. Serve in the bake-dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Corn.</span></h3>

<p>See Thursday, Fourth Week in June.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cherry Soufflé.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups of milk; 1 cup of prepared flour; 5 eggs; 4
tablespoonfuls sugar; 1 teaspoonful bitter almond flavoring;
1 cup of stoned cherries, dredged with flour; a pinch
of salt.</p>

<p>Scald the milk and pour it—a little at a time—upon
the flour, stirring constantly, to a smooth batter. Return
to the custard kettle, and stir until thick as hasty pudding.
Pour, still hot, upon the yolks beaten up with the sugar.
Whip up thoroughly and let it cool. Whisk the whites very
stiff and beat rapidly into the cold paste. Butter a mould,
line thickly with the dredged cherries, and put in the mixture,
carefully, not to disturb the cherries, which should
stick to the buttered sides. Allow room for swelling in
the mould. Put on the top, set in a pot of boiling water,
and cook for an hour and a half. Dip into cold water,
and turn out upon a hot dish. Eat soon, with a good
pudding sauce.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Plain Calf’s Head Soup.</span></h3>

<p>1 lb. of lean beef cut into strips and fried brown, with
a sliced onion, in dripping; 1 grated carrot; 1 sliced turnip;
bunch of herbs chopped; pot-liquor from yesterday’s
calf’s head.</p>

<p>Skim the cold broth, and put on with the fried meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
and onions, the herbs and vegetables. Cook gently three
hours, and strain. Add a tablespoonful—heaping—of
browned flour wet in cold water; simmer a minute, and
put in the cold tongue and brains—kept from yesterday—cut
into dice. Cook gently three minutes, and pour
out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Chickens.</span></h3>

<p>Cut up a pair of young chickens, as for fricassee. Lay
in cold water for one minute, and, without wiping them,
pepper and salt each piece; roll in flour and fry in hot
lard to a fine brown. Pile upon a hot-water dish; fry
some whole bunches of green parsley in the lard, and lay
over and about them. This is the famous fried chicken
of the South.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Kidney-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Boil tender in hot salted water, drain, and when nearly
cold, mash them, partially, leaving here and there a whole
grain. Have ready in a frying-pan some strips of fat
salt pork fried crisp in their own grease. Season this
with pepper, and stir in the beans. Cook, stirring briskly,
until smoking hot. Dish with the crisped pork on top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">New Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Rub, or scrape off the skins; cook until tender, in hot
salted water; dry in the open pot on the range, after draining
them, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beets Sautés.</span></h3>

<p>Boil and slice as for plain boiled beets. Put into a
saucepan with a great spoonful of butter, the same of vinegar,
with pepper and salt. Shake and toss until they are
glazed with the hot butter; then dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce Salad.</span></h3>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soup à la Bonne Femme.</span></h3>

<p>2 lbs. of good white fish—halibut, bass, or pickerel will
do; 3 eggs; 1 cup of milk; 1 onion; bunch of sweet
herbs; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter rubbed in flour; cayenne
and salt to taste; a little nutmeg; 3 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Boil together fish, herbs, and onion in cold water for
two hours. Strain; pick the fish from the bones, and
chop so fine that you can rub it through the colander into
the soup. Season, and put back into the soup-pot. Simmer
ten minutes and stir in the butter. Heat the milk
in a farina-kettle; pour it upon the beaten eggs, and stir
over the fire until it <i>begins</i> to thicken. Pour into the
tureen, add the soup, stir up well, and serve. It is well to
add a pinch of soda to the milk in heating.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Ducks.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and stuff the ducks; adding sage and onion
to the force-meat for <i>one</i>. Fill the other with the ordinary
poultry dressing. Lay in the dripping-pan; pour a cup
of boiling water over them, and roast, basting often, about
twelve minutes to the pound, unless they are very young
and tender. Take them up; strain the gravy, and take
off the fat. Season; thicken with browned flour, and pour
into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Whip boiled mealy potatoes to pieces with a fork, and,
when they are a powdery pile, whip in butter, milk, and
salt. They should be light and creamy. Pile roughly
upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Shell; lay in cold water fifteen minutes; put on in boiling
salted water, with a lump of loaf-sugar, if they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
market peas. Boil twenty minutes, if young; drain very
dry; dish, and season with pepper, salt and plenty of butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Peel with a keen knife. Slice, and lay in a glass bowl,
and pour on a dressing made by rubbing together half a
teaspoonful each of pepper, salt, sugar, and made mustard,
with two tablespoonfuls of best oil, beating into this,
a few drops at a time, five tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and
at last the yolk of a raw egg. Set the salad upon the ice
for half an hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Currant and Raspberry Tart.</span></h3>

<p>Mix together three cups of currants and one of raspberries.
Sweeten abundantly; fill shells of good pie-paste
with them; cover with crust, and bake. Eat cold, with
powdered sugar sifted over them.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pea and Tomato Soup.</span></h3>

<p>1 lb. of lean ham; 2 lbs. of lean beef; 2 lbs. of lean
veal; 2 onions; bunch of sweet herbs; 12 tomatoes;
1 quart of green peas; 5 quarts of water; pepper and
salt to taste; corn-starch; sugar.</p>

<p>Cook the meat, cut into strips, and the herbs and onions
in the cold water four hours. Strain; put the meat and
half the stock on the ice—after seasoning well—for Sunday.
Season the rest, when you have cooled and skimmed
it, and put over the fire with the sliced tomatoes and
peas. Boil slowly half an hour. Pulp through a colander;
stir in a tablespoonful of corn-starch wet with cold
water, and a tablespoonful of white sugar. Simmer five
minutes, and pour out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salmi of Ducks.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the meat neatly from the bones, having the slices as
nearly as possible of uniform size. Make a gravy of the
bones, stuffing, skin, etc., and a quart of water, boiling
gently down to one large cupful. Skim and strain this
into a saucepan. Add the juice of a lemon, and browned
flour for thickening; stir smooth, and lay in the sliced
duck. Warm slowly at one side of the range, but do not
let it boil. When very hot, pour upon oblong slices of
fried toast covering the bottom of a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Peel, quarter, and boil soft. Mash in a hot colander,
pressing hard. Serve in a deep dish, with butter, pepper,
and salt beaten in.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off the strings from both sides; cut into short
lengths, and cook tender in boiling salt water. They require
twice as much time as peas. Drain, season with
pepper, salt, and butter. Set aside half for to-morrow’s
salad.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cucumbers.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and lay in ice-water one hour. Slice; put upon a
lump of ice in a salad-dish, and season to taste upon saucers
after they are helped out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Almond Corn-Starch Blanc-Mange.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 4 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch; 3 eggs;
¼ lb. almonds, blanched, dried, and pounded; rose-water
and bitter almond; ¾ cup of powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Scald the milk, with a pinch of soda stirred in. Have
the almonds beaten to a paste with a teaspoonful of rose-water,
and stir into the hot milk. Simmer five minutes;
then strain through thin muslin, pressing hard upon the
almonds. Add this, hot, to the beaten eggs and sugar;
put upon the fire, and stir in, with the eggs, the corn-starch
wet up in cold milk, never taking the spoon out until it
is thick. Take off; flavor, and pour into a wet mould.
Set in ice, and it will soon form. Eat with sugar and
cream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from your cold stock, and strain it from
the meat. Boil up once and skim. Add half a cup of
rice, and simmer until this is very tender. Add the water
in which have been soaked two tablespoonfuls of burnt
sugar, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Veal with Garnish of Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Take the large bones from a piece of loin of veal; stuff
the cavities thus made with a good force-meat of chopped
pork crumbs and seasoning—a few chopped mushrooms
are an improvement—cover the sides with greased sheets
of thick writing-paper; put a cupful of soup stock or other
gravy in the dripping-pan, and baste well, for one hour
with butter and water, afterwards with the gravy. Cook
fully twelve minutes to the pound. Take off the paper
during the last half hour; dredge with flour, baste with
butter, and brown nicely. Take up and keep hot while
you skim the fat from the gravy, stir into it half a cupful
of chopped mushrooms and a little browned flour. Serve
this—having cooked it three minutes—in a boat. Have
ready some green peas, boiled and seasoned, and make a
fence of them about the veal when dished.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bean Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the beans into inch-lengths, pile in a salad-dish and
pour upon them such a dressing as you compounded for
the raw tomatoes on Friday of Second Week in July.
Garnish with curled lettuce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Snow.</span></h3>

<p>4 large sweet oranges, all the juice, and the grated peel
of one; juice and half the grated peel of 1 lemon; 1
package of Coxe’s gelatine soaked in a cup of cold water;
whites of 4 eggs, whipped stiff; 1 large cup of white
sugar; 3 cups of boiling water.</p>

<p>Mix the juice, and peel of the fruit with the soaked
gelatine, also the sugar. Leave them covered for one
hour, then pour on the boiling water and stir clear.
Strain through flannel, wringing hard. When quite cold,
whip in the frothed whites very gradually until the mixture
is a white sponge. Put into a wet mould on Saturday, and
set on the ice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Iced Tea and Cake.</span></h3>

<p>Set the tea aside after breakfast in a pitcher, or bottle,
which you can keep in ice. When you serve it, half fill
each glass with ice, put in more sugar than you would use
for hot tea, and pour on the cold liquid.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Summer Squash, or Cymbling Soup.</span></h3>

<p>The bones from your cold veal; 2 lbs. lean, raw veal,
chopped fine; 1 onion; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter rubbed
in flour; 1 cup of milk, with a pinch of soda; 1 tablespoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
of white sugar; 2 beaten eggs; 2 good-sized white
squash pared and quartered; pepper and salt; fried bread;
4 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Boil bones, meat, and onions in four quarts of water
until this is reduced to two. Strain, cool, and take off the
fat. Cook the squash in one pint of the stock until soft
enough to rub through a colander; pulp, and put this, with
its liquor, in the remaining three pints of broth; also the
sugar, seasoning, and floured butter, and cook slowly
without boiling, five minutes. Heat the milk, pour upon
the eggs, stir over the fire until it begins to thicken. Put
dice of fried bread into the tureen; pour on the milk and
eggs, then the soup, and stir up well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Veal.</span></h3>

<p>Chop the cold veal and stuffing; put a layer into a
greased bake-dish; season, and wet with the cold gravy.
Lay chopped mushrooms upon this; then bread-crumbs,
with butter scattered over them. More meat seasoning,
mushrooms and crumbs should fill the dish, with plenty of
crumbs, profusely buttered, on top. Wet each layer of
meat with gravy. Cover the dish, and bake until it bubbles
on top. Brown lightly, and send to table in the dish
in which it was cooked.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Peel, slice, and cook soft in boiling salted water.
Mash in a hot colander, pressing well. Season with salt,
pepper and butter; smooth into a heap in a root-dish,
and put pats of pepper on top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>See Wednesday of Second Week in July.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes, Boiled Whole.</span></h3>

<p>Peel as thin as possible. Put on in boiling water, a
little salt, and cook fifteen minutes. Then, pour in a pint
of cold water. This checks the boil and throws the meal,
or starch, to the surface. Increase the heat, and boil
until a fork will pierce the largest. Throw off the water;
set the pot on the range, and let the moisture evaporate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
Put the potatoes in a deep dish; pour upon them a few
spoonfuls of melted butter mixed with chopped parsley,
and serve.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bread-and-Cheese Porridge.</span></h3>

<p>2 lbs. of beef-bones cracked; 2 lbs. coarse mutton—lean
and chopped; 1 lb. stale bread-crusts, dried to
crispness in the oven; 4 quarts of water; 4 tablespoonfuls
fine grated cheese; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, rolled
in flour; pepper, salt, and chopped parsley; 1 onion.</p>

<p>Put on the bones, meat, and onion in the water, and
boil three hours. Cool, and take off the fat. Season,
and re-heat. Put in the crusts; cook very slowly until
they are like a jelly. Take them from the fire; beat in a
bowl until smooth; put back into the soup, and simmer
fifteen minutes. Stir in the butter; cook five minutes,
and pour upon the cheese in the tureen. Stir up well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lamb Chops.</span></h3>

<p>Trim very neatly, and broil upon a buttered gridiron
over a clear fire, turning often. Wind a strip of frilled
tissue-paper about the bit of bare bone left upon each one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Purée of Peas and Onion.</span></h3>

<p>Take a cupful of broth from your soup-pot, before
adding the bread. Cool, and take off the fat, and return
to the fire with two quarts of green peas and a sliced
onion. Set the vessel containing it in a saucepan of
boiling water, and cook, closely covered, until the peas
begin to break. Put into a bowl; bruise the peas with a
potato pestle, and return to the fire with the liquor in
which they were stewed. Add a little parsley and a lump
of sugar, with pepper, salt, and butter. Simmer five minutes,
and turn out into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Shell, and cook in boiling, salted water twenty-five
minutes. Drain, season, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Moulded Potato.</span></h3>

<p>Mash—or rather, beat up lightly with a fork. Work in
butter and milk, but do not get it too soft. Fill small
cups—wet with cold water—with the potato, pack down
firmly and turn out upon a greased bake-pan. Brown in
a quick oven until they are of a russet hue; glazing with
butter, as they color. Transfer to a flat, hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Currants and Raspberries.</span></h3>

<p>Slightly mash the currants, leaving as many whole ones
as you break. Sweeten plentifully, and, just before serving,
mix with them an equal quantity of red or white
raspberries, fresh and whole.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ox-tail Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 ox-tails; bunch of thyme and parsley; 1 large onion,
sliced; 2 grated carrots; ½ lb. fat salt pork; 6 quarts of
water; 1 small onion stuck with six cloves; browned
flour; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter.</p>

<p>Slice the pork, and fry. When the fat has covered the
bottom of the pan, put in the large sliced onion and fry
to a good brown. Then add the tails, cut at each joint.
When they have been in five minutes, take them out and
put into the soup-pot with the fried onion and water.
Cover and cook slowly two hours. Then put in the carrots,
herbs, and clove onion, and stew two hours more.
Strain, pulping the vegetables; cool, take off the fat, and
season the soup. Put over the fire, and when it again
simmers, stir in the butter <i>melted</i> and rubbed into the
browned flour to form a paste. Boil up once and it is
ready. Put the remnants of the tails into a jar, or bowl,
and add to them half the soup. When cold put on ice
for to-morrow.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak with Wine Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Flatten and broil your steak as usual, but when you
lay it upon the hot-water dish, have ready this sauce: 1
glass of brown sherry; 1 large spoonful of mushroom or
walnut catsup; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, rolled in a
mere dust of flour; pepper and salt to taste. Heat to
boiling—quickly—in a saucepan, and when it has been
poured upon the steak, cover and let stand a few minutes
before you serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in two waters. Drain, and if they are large, cut
into quarters, and pour over them a cup of scalding milk—in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
which a pinch of soda has been stirred. Set over the
fire, add a tablespoonful of butter, half a teaspoonful of
corn-starch, wet with milk, a little minced parsley, with pepper
and salt. Simmer three minutes, and pour out.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ambrosia Custard.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 5 eggs; 4 tablespoonfuls of sugar for
custard and 2 for <i>méringue</i>; 1 grated cocoanut; bitter
almond flavoring.</p>

<p>Heat the milk; pour upon the sugar beaten up with
the yolks of all the eggs and the whites of two. Cook,
stirring all the time, until it begins to thicken. Pour it

<h3><span class="smcap">Yesterday’s Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take every particle of fat from the cake of soup jelly
you will find in your refrigerator; add a cup of boiling
water to thin it sufficiently to pour off from the meat;
strain it into the soup-pot, boil gently once and skim; add
seasoning if you find it needed, also a glass of wine and
the juice of a lemon, and pour out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Chickens.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash out in several waters, and stuff with crumbs
mixed in tepid water, then drained and put over the fire
in a saucepan with a little hot butter in the bottom. Stir
the crumbs until hot and almost dry, add chopped parsley,
salt and pepper; take it off and beat in two frothed eggs.
Fill the chickens, sew up the vents, and tie up the necks.
Cover the breasts with very greasy writing-paper. Put a
cup of boiling water into the dripping-pan and roast one
hour, basting freely. Ten minutes before taking up the
fowls, remove the papers and baste the breasts three
times with butter while browning. Pour off the fat from
the gravy; add the chopped yolks of two eggs, a little
browned flour, with pepper and salt. Boil up and serve
in a boat.</p>

<p>Salt the giblets slightly and keep upon ice for to-morrow’s
soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and cut in rather large dice. Stew twenty minutes
in boiling salted water. Pour nearly all of this off and
put on as much cold milk. Stew ten minutes more; stir
in a tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour; a little minced
parsley, pepper and salt. Simmer five minutes and pour
out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Select enough large, smooth tomatoes to fill a bake-dish.
Cut a piece from the top of each to serve as a
cover. Scoop out the pulp, taking care not to injure the
skin. Chop up a few spoonfuls of the meat from the
soup; mix with it a little chopped pork and bread-crumbs.
Add the tomato-pulp, pepper and sugar, and fill the skins.
Put on the tops, and bake, covered, half an hour. Uncover
and brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Corn Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>See Saturday, First Week in July.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Méringue Pie.</span></h3>

<p>3 eggs; 1 great spoonful of butter; ¾ cup of white
sugar. Juice and grated peel of 1 lemon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>Cream butter and sugar; beat in yolks and lemon, and
fill one large open shell of paste, or two small ones. Beat
the whites to a stiff <i>méringue</i>, with three tablespoonfuls of
powdered sugar, and a little rose-water. When the pies
are done, draw to the door of the oven, spread quickly
with this mixture, and shut them in again for three minutes.
Eat cold.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Giblet Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Break up the skeletons of your roast chicken. Put
bones, stuffing, and giblets into a soup-pot with four quarts
of water. Boil one hour, and take out the giblets. Boil
the rest an hour more; strain, cool, and skim. Then put
back over the fire to simmer. Meanwhile, you should
have fried an onion—sliced—in two tablespoonfuls of
butter; then taking out the onion, have stirred in a <i>great</i>
spoonful of browned flour, and cooked it, stirring incessantly
five minutes. Now thin this mixture with a few
spoonfuls of your soup, and strain it into the soup-kettle.
Lastly, add the chopped giblets; season well, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Halibut à la Royale.</span></h3>

<p>6 lbs. of halibut in one piece; ½ cup of bread-crumbs;
2 tablespoonfuls chopped fat salt pork; 2 teaspoonfuls
essence of anchovy; ¼ cup of melted butter; 1 cup of boiling
water. Juice of 1 lemon. Pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Lay the halibut in salt and water two hours. Wipe it;
make incisions on each side of the back-bone, and put in
a dressing made of bread-crumbs, chopped pork, pepper,
salt and a little anchovy. Pour into the bottom of a neat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
bake-dish the butter, hot water, lemon and anchovy essence.
Lay in the fish; cover, and bake one hour, basting
often. Send to table in the dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Cutlets.</span></h3>

<p>The meat of your cold fowls chopped very fine; 1 cupful
of drawn butter or gravy; 4 eggs; ½ cupful of bread-crumbs;
pepper and salt; beaten egg and rolled cracker.</p>

<p>Put the gravy into a saucepan, and when hot, stir in
the meat, well seasoned, and the bread-crumbs. As they
heat, add the beaten eggs, and mix all well together, stirring
constantly for three minutes; then pour out upon a
broad dish to cool. When cold and stiff, cut into oblong
cakes, three inches long by two wide; dip in egg, then in
cracker, and fry in hot lard. Drain, and pile upon a flat
dish, log-cabin-wise, and serve.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee Cream.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of rich milk; 1 cup of strong, made coffee; 1
pint of sweet cream, whipped in a syllabub churn; yolks
of 3 beaten eggs; 1 cup of sugar; 1 package of Cooper’s
Gelatine, soaked one hour in a little cold water.</p>

<p>Scald the milk; add a pinch of soda; put in the hot
coffee, and pour upon the beaten yolks and sugar. Return
to the fire, and stir until it begins to thicken; when,
add the gelatine, and take off. Stir until the gelatine has
dissolved. When perfectly cold, whip in, by degrees, the
frothed cream, and put in a wet mould to form. Keep
upon the ice until wanted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Julienne Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 lbs. of beef, and the same of lean veal; 1 lb. of lean
ham; 2 carrots; 2 turnips; 2 onions; 1 cup of Lima
beans; 3 tablespoonfuls of butter; sweet herbs; pepper
and salt; 6 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Cut the meat small, and cook with herbs in the water
four hours. Strain. Put the meat and half of the stock,
well seasoned, upon the ice. Cool the rest, skim, season,
and put back into the pot. Prepare your vegetables in the
following manner: Put the butter into a frying-pan, and
when hot, fry the onion, sliced, in it; then, carrots and
turnips cut into strips less than an inch long. When they
have cooked five minutes, put them into the soup. Simmer
half an hour; skim, and put in the beans. Cook
gently half an hour more, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Stew with Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Take three pounds from the breast, and cut it into
inch-square pieces. Dredge these with flour, and fry
brown in good dripping; add a small, sliced onion, and a
tablespoonful of chopped herbs. Cover well with cold
water, put on the saucepan-lid, and stew gently until very
tender. Take out the meat, and keep hot over boiling
water; strain and season the gravy; put in a quart of
young peas, and stew slowly until the peas are done.
Put back the meat, boil up once, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash two cups of potatoes light and smooth; season
with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg, and beat in two
eggs. Put a spoonful of dripping into a frying-pan, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
when it hisses, stir in the potato mixture. Keep stirring
until it is very hot. Spread upon a dish to cool. When
cold, mould into croquettes; dip in beaten egg, then in
rolled cracker, and fry to a fine yellow-brown. Drain
well, and heap upon a dish.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Soup with Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>1 large chicken; 4 quarts of water; 1 cup of milk; 1
cup of raw rice; pepper, salt, and chopped parsley; 6 eggs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>Put on the chicken, trussed, but not stuffed, in the
water with the rice. Boil three hours, or until the bones
are ready to slip from the meat. Take out the chicken,
salt it and put by in a cool place for to-morrow. Cool
and skim the soup; season it, and rub through a soup-sieve
back into the pot, rice and all. The rice should be
boiled to pieces, and pass freely through the sieve. Put
in the parsley, and simmer, while you heat the milk in a
separate vessel, and poach an egg for each person who is
to partake of the soup. Trim each egg round when you
have taken it from the water, and lay carefully upon a flat
dish. Pour the hot milk into the tureen; then the soup.
Stir well, and lay the eggs upon the top, one by one,
taking pains not to break them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Braised Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Lay a piece of beef-fillet, without bone, weighing five
or six pounds, in a broad pot. Scatter sliced onion over
it, salt slightly, and, if you have any good gravy, add this
to the cupful of boiling water you pour over the meat.
Cover tightly, and cook slowly an hour and a half, adding
boiling water should the gravy sink too low. When done,
dredge with flour, set in a hot oven, and, as the flour
browns, baste with butter, to glaze. It should not remain
longer than ten minutes in the oven. Strain the gravy;
pour off the top fat; put into a saucepan with a little
browned flour and a tablespoonful of catsup. Boil until
thickened; pour a few spoonfuls over the meat, the rest
into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Cook as on Wednesday, Third Week in July.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Whipped Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, boil, and dry out the potatoes, and whip, first
into powder, then, adding milk and butter, to a cream;
at last, beat in the stiffened white of an egg. Pile roughly
in a deep dish, and set in the oven to warm up, but not
to “crust” or brown, and send to table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, quarter, boil in hot, salted water, and mash. Put
into a saucepan a half-cup of hot milk, a tablespoonful
of butter rolled in flour, and a little salt and pepper.
Stir in the squash until well mixed and ready to boil.
Turn out into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Refer to Friday, Second Week in July.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Claret Jelly and Cake.</span></h3>

<p>1 package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in a large cup of
water; 2 cups of sugar; 2 cups fine claret; 1 pint of
boiling water; the juice of one lemon; a pinch of mace.</p>

<p>Put soaked gelatine, sugar, and lemon together, and
cover for half an hour. Pour on the boiling water; stir
until melted, and strain through a flannel bag. Add the
wine, and strain, without squeezing, through double flannel.
Put in a wet mould, and set in ice. Turn out upon
a cold glass dish, and pass cake with it. Make it on
Saturday.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Baked Soup.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of lean mutton, boneless, and cut into strips, 1
carrot; 1 turnip; 1 onion—all cut into dice; 6 ripe
tomatoes, sliced thin; 1 pint young green peas; 1 cup of
green corn cut from the cob; bunch of sweet herbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
chopped; 2 quarts of cold water; pepper and salt; 1
tablespoonful of sugar; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, cut
into bits and rolled in flour.</p>

<p>Put all these into a stout stone jar early in the day.
Fit on a tight top, putting a paste of flour and water over
the crack between the mouth of the jar and the cover, and
set within a dripping-pan of boiling water in the oven.
Do nothing more to it until dinner-time, except to add
more boiling water as that in the pan evaporates. When
ready for the soup, pour into the tureen without straining.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Scallop.</span></h3>

<p>Cut cold boiled chicken into pieces less than an inch
long. Have ready a cup of yesterday’s soup in a saucepan—or
some drawn butter—and, when hot, stir in the
meat. Just boil, and pour upon a beaten egg. Cover the
bottom of a bake-dish with fine crumbs; pour in the mixture,
rather highly seasoned; strew with more crumbs;
put drops of butter over the surface, and bake, covered,
half an hour; then brown quickly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Shell, and boil in hot salted water from twenty to
twenty-five minutes, adding a lump of sugar, if they are
not freshly gathered. Drain well; dish, and season with
pepper, salt, and butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">New Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape off the skins, and cook in boiling salted water,
until a fork will go in easily. Turn off all the water.
Set the uncovered pot for a moment upon the range, throwing
in a little fine salt. Then send up in a dish, with a
napkin thrown lightly over it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce.</span></h3>

<p>Do not trouble yourself to-day with making salad-dressing.
Pick apart the lettuce leaves, put into a salad-bowl
with cracked ice below and among them, and pass the oil,
pepper, salt, and vinegar with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Huckleberries, Cream, and Cake.</span></h3>

<p>Pick over and wash the berries. Drain, and serve in a
glass dish. Send around sugar and cream with them, and
follow with the cake-basket.</p>

——<br />
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potage aux Croûtons.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of lean beef; fried bread; 1 onion, sliced; 3
quarts of water; chopped herbs; 1 carrot, cut up; pepper,
salt, and 1 great spoonful of clear catsup—walnut or
mushroom; dripping.</p>

<p>Fry meat and vegetables ten minutes in plenty of hot
dripping. Drain this off, and set by in the pan while you
put meat, vegetables, and herbs on in the water, and set
where they will heat slowly to a boil. Prepare the <i>croûtons</i>
by cutting out, with the top of a pepper-box, small
rounds of stale bread, and frying them in the dripping
used for the beef, etc. Drain, and set these in an open
oven, that they may get very dry. Boil the soup three
hours. Strain; cool, skim, season; boil and skim five
minutes, and put in the <i>croûtons</i>. Heat three minutes,
but do not boil, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Devilled Crab.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup of crab-meat, picked from the shells of well-boiled
crabs; 2 tablespoonfuls of fine bread-crumbs or rolled
cracker; yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, chopped; juice
of a lemon; ½ teaspoonful of made mustard; a little
Cayenne pepper and salt; 1 cup of good drawn butter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p>Mix one spoonful of the crumbs with the chopped crab-meat,
yolks, seasoning, and drawn butter. Fill scallop-shells—large
clam-shells will do, or small paté-pans—with
the mixture; sift crumbs over the top, and heat to slight
browning in a quick oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corned Beef and Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Cook the beef in plenty of cold water, bringing slowly
to the boil. Cook fifteen minutes to the pound after it
begins to simmer. When about three-quarters done put
in a dozen turnips, peeled and quartered. When you
dish the beef, lay these—unmashed—about it. Serve the
meat with drawn butter, having as a base the pot-liquor.
Save the rest of the liquor for to-morrow’s soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Shell, and cook in boiling salted water about twenty-five
minutes. Then drain, pour over them a little drawn
butter, well peppered, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beets.</span></h3>

<p>Be careful, in cutting off the tops and washing them, not
to break the skins, or they will bleed away their color in
the water. Cook in boiling water one hour. Scrape;
slice; salt, pepper, and butter, and pour a few spoonfuls
of boiling vinegar upon them after they are dished.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Plain Boiled Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>3 heaping cups of flour; 2 cups of buttermilk or “loppered”
milk; 1 <i>full</i> teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in boiling
water; ½ cupful of powdered suet; 1 teaspoonful of
salt.</p>

<p>Stir the sour milk into the flour gradually until it is free
from lumps. Put in salt and suet; lastly, beat in the soda
water quickly and faithfully. Put into a buttered mould,
and boil an hour and a half. Eat hot with sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Butter (or Lima) Bean Soup.</span></h3>

<p>The pot-liquor from your beef; 1 quart of butter (or
Lima) beans; ½ cup corn-meal, scalded and left to cool;
1 onion; bunch of parsley; 2 teaspoonfuls essence of
celery; 2 beaten eggs; pepper.</p>

<p>Take the fat from the pot-liquor and put over the fire
with the beans, onion, and scalded meal. The latter
should be soft as thin mush. Stir until this is well mixed
with the soup, and boil gently, stirring now and then,
until the beans are broken to pieces. Rub to a <i>purée</i>
through a colander; put in pepper and chopped parsley.
Simmer five minutes, and pour a cupful upon the beaten
eggs. Stir this back into the soup; cook one minute,
without quite boiling, and serve. Pass sliced lemon with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breaded Veal Cutlets.</span></h3>

<p>Trim and flatten the cutlets; pepper and salt, and roll
in beaten egg; then in pounded cracker. Fry rather
slowly in good dripping; turning when the lower side is
brown. Drain off the fat; squeeze a little lemon-juice
upon each, and serve in a hot, flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash very soft with butter and milk; season and heap
irregularly upon a dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Succotash.</span></h3>

<p>6 ears of corn; 1 pint of string-beans, trimmed and
cut into short pieces; 1 tablespoonful of butter rolled in
flour; 1 cup of milk; pepper and salt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span></p>

<p>Cut the corn from the cob, bruising as little as possible.
Put over the fire with the beans in enough hot water,
salted, to cover them, and stew gently half an hour.
Turn off nearly all the water, and add a cupful of milk.
Simmer in this, stirring to prevent burning, twenty minutes;
add the floured butter, the pepper and salt, and
stew ten minutes. Serve in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Devilled Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>12 fine, firm tomatoes, pared and sliced nearly half an
inch thick; yolks of 3 hard-boiled eggs, pounded; 3
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, and same of vinegar; 2
raw eggs, beaten light; 1 teaspoonful sugar, and half as
much, each, of made mustard and salt; a pinch of
Cayenne.</p>

<p>Rub butter, pounded yolks, pepper, salt, mustard and
sugar together. Beat hard, add vinegar, and heat to a
boil. Put this upon the beaten eggs and whip to a smooth
cream. Set in hot water while you broil the tomatoes in
an oyster-broiler, over clear coals. Lay this upon a hot
chafing-dish, and pour the scalding dressing upon them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Huckleberry Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 pint of milk; 2 eggs; 1 quart of flour (sifted); 1 gill
yeast; 1 saltspoonful of salt; 1 teaspoonful of boiling
water; nearly a quart of berries, dredged with flour.</p>

<p>Make a batter of these ingredients—leaving out the
berries—and set in a warm place to rise, for about four
hours. If light then, stir in the dredged berries; pour
into a buttered cake-mould, and bake one hour in a moderate
oven. Turn out, and eat with hard sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

upon dice of fried bread in the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Chicken.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and cut the fowls into joints. Put a layer
of fat salt pork in the bottom of a pot; lay the chicken
upon this; pepper and salt. Cover with more pork, and
pour in three tablespoonfuls of hot water mixed with as
much butter. Finally, drop in a little minced onion.
Cover tightly, and heat very slowly. After the chickens
begin to stew, cook steadily one hour, if they are tender.
If not, increase the time at discretion. When they are
done, take up and keep hot. Add a little boiling water
to the gravy; strain, thicken with browned flour, boil up
and pour upon the fowls.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Onions with Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Boil fifteen minutes in hot salted water. Throw this
off; add a little gravy (made, if you have none ready,
by boiling a chicken-scrag and feet in a pint of water,
until there is less than a cupful of broth, then seasoning
and thickening this), with chopped parsley. Stew five
minutes longer, or until tender, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Pea Cakes.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups of boiled green peas, mashed hot with pepper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
salt, and butter; 2 beaten eggs; 1 cup of milk; ½ cup
of prepared flour.</p>

<p>Mix and beat hard. Fry as you would griddle-cakes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Lyonnaise.</span></h3>

<p>Chop cold parboiled potatoes into coarse dice. Put
some butter in a frying-pan, and, when hot, throw in a tablespoonful
of chopped onion and a little parsley. Cook
one minute; add the potatoes, and stir until very hot and
glazed with the butter, but not until colored. Serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Cup Custards.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 5 eggs; 1 cup of sugar; lemon flavoring
for custard, and lemon-juice for the <i>méringue</i>.</p>

<p>Heat the milk, add all but two tablespoonfuls of sugar
to the beaten yolks of all the eggs and the whites of two,
and pour the scalding milk upon them, mixing in well.
Fill buttered stone-china cups with this custard; set in a
dripping-pan of hot water, and bake until “set.” Then
pile upon them roughly a <i>méringue</i> made of the reserved
whites, whipped stiff with the rest of the powdered sugar
and the lemon-juice. Shut the oven until these begin to
be tinged. Eat cold from the cups.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Corn Soup.</span></h3>

<p>1 pint of grated corn just from the cob; 3 pints of
boiling water; 1 pint of hot milk; 3 tablespoonfuls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
butter; 1 heaping tablespoonful of flour; pepper; salt;
yolks of 2 eggs.</p>

<p>Put on the cobs, after you have grated off the corn, in
the boiling water, and cook half an hour. Take them out
and put in the corn. Boil one hour or until very soft.
Pulp through the colander back into the water. Season,
and set over the fire to simmer. Put the butter into a
saucepan, and, when hot, stir in the flour. Cook ten
minutes, stirring all the while. Add a little of the soup
to thin it, and empty the saucepan into the soup-pot, stirring
the contents until smooth. Heat the milk in another
saucepan, pour upon the beaten yolks, cook one minute,
and pour into the tureen. Season with pepper and salt,
and stir the soup into it. This is a remarkably nice soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mayonnaise of Lobster.</span></h3>

<p>Meat of one large boiled lobster, cold and cut into
dice. Lay aside the coral for the dressing. Make this
of these ingredients: 4 hard boiled eggs; 2 tablespoonfuls
best salad-oil; 1 teaspoonful, each, of made mustard,
salt, white sugar, and anchovy sauce; vinegar and cayenne
to taste.</p>

<p>Pound the yolks perfectly smooth, and rub in the coral
and other ingredients with great care, moistening with
vinegar as they stiffen, until a smooth cream is the result.
Pour this over the minced lobster, and toss up well with
a silver fork. Heap in the centre of your salad-bowl, and
lay cool, white lettuce-hearts around it, helping out these
with the lobster. Inside of the lettuce lay a chain of the
sliced boiled whites.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak au Maître D’Hôtel.</span></h3>

<p>Broil your beefsteak in the usual manner. Lay upon
the chafing-dish and pour upon it a sauce made of 1 great
spoonful of butter; 1 teaspoonful very finely minced parsley;
pepper, salt and the juice of a lemon—heated <i>almost</i>
to boiling in a clean saucepan. Put a hot cover over the
steak, and let it stand five minutes before serving.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in hot salted water fifteen minutes. Drain half of
this off and stir in—for a quart of beans—a tablespoonful
of <i>very</i> finely chopped sweet salt pork—the whitest fat
slice you can get—a teaspoonful of minced onion, a little
chopped parsley; pepper and a cupful of hot milk, with a
pinch of soda stirred in to prevent curdling. Stew slowly
fifteen minutes more; stir in a scant tablespoonful of butter
rolled in flour; cook ten minutes and pour out.</p>

sifted over it.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kilkenny Soup.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of lean beef; 2 lbs. scrag of mutton, cut up
small; 1 lb. lean ham; 3 sliced onions; 3 carrots; 2 turnips;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
bunch of sweet herbs; ⅔ of a cup of Irish oatmeal,
previously soaked four hours in a little tepid water; 6
quarts of cold water; pepper and salt; 6 parboiled potatoes,
sliced.</p>

<p>Crack the bones, and cut the meat into strips. Cover
with the water, and bring slowly to the boil. When this
has lasted one hour, skim off the top of the pot, and put
in the onions fried brown in dripping, the other vegetables
sliced, and the herbs; cook three hours longer, and
strain the soup. Season the meat pretty highly and pour
upon it—in a jar or bowl—half the clear stock. Set upon
the ice for Sunday, when cold. Rub the vegetables
through the colander into the rest of the stock; cool,
take off the fat, season, add the sliced potatoes and the
oatmeal, and cook one hour more. Strain into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Chops.</span></h3>

<p>Trim, leaving a bit of bare bone at the end of each.
Pepper, and broil over a clear fire. Lay upon a hot dish;
salt and butter both sides of each chop, and lay outside
of your stewed tomatoes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ragoût of Vegetables.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil 1 carrot, 1 turnip, 2 potatoes, 2 ears of corn, 1
cup of Lima beans, and the same of peas, 1 onion, and
with them ¼ lb. of fat salt pork. Drain off the water, and
lay aside the pork. Slice carrots, turnips, potatoes and
onion. Put into a saucepan with a cup of your soup
taken out before thickening; season well; cut the corn
from the cob and add with the peas, beans, and a sliced
tomato as soon as the rest are hot. Stew all together
half an hour. Stir in a great lump of butter rolled in
flour; stew five minutes and pour into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Loosen the skins with hot water, peel and slice. Stew
until broken to pieces. Pulp through a coarse sieve, rubbing
out all that will pass. Return to the fire with a little
sugar, pepper and salt, and boil briskly fifteen minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
Stir in, then, enough fine crumbs to make it like a tolerably
thick batter; add a great spoonful of butter; stew,
stirring well, five minutes; pour in the middle of a flat
dish, and arrange the chops around it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Indian Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 4 cups white Indian meal; 3 eggs;
4 tablespoonfuls of sugar; 1 teaspoonful of salt; ¼ lb.
powdered suet; 1 teaspoonful of cinnamon; ¼ teaspoonful
of soda in the milk.</p>

<p>Scald the milk, and, while hot, stir in meal, suet, and salt.
When cold, beat in the yolks and sugar, the spice—at last
the whites. Beat long and hard; pour into a buttered
mould, leaving room for swelling—and plenty of it—put
into a pot of boiling water almost up to the top, and boil
<i>four</i> hours. Turn out, and eat hot with sauce.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from your cold soup; pour the latter carefully
from the meat, and heat to a slow boil. Having removed
all the scum that will rise, add a quarter pound of
macaroni, broken into short pieces, boiled twenty minutes
in hot salted water, and left to get cold. Simmer fifteen
minutes, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Ducks.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and truss neatly, but do not stuff the
ducks. Put into a broad saucepan, such as is generally
known as a braising-pan. Strew with a little onion; pour
over them a cupful of weak broth made by boiling the giblets
in a pint of water and reducing one-half. Season this
well, and when you have poured it upon the ducks, cover
the saucepan and cook gently an hour and a half or until
the ducks are tender. Turn them when half done. Take
up when ready; keep hot while you strain and thicken
the gravy with browned flour. Pour a little over the
ducks, the rest into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>See Monday, Fourth Week in July.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Corn.</span></h3>

<p>Strip off all except the inner thin husk. Turn this
down, and pick off the silk. Put back the husk, tie with
a bit of thread, and cook in boiling water from twenty-five
to thirty minutes. Break off the stalks and husks, and
send to table wrapped in a napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Egg-plant.</span></h3>

<p>Cut in slices half an inch thick; pare each carefully,
and lay for one hour in salt and water, to remove the bitter
taste. Then slightly salt and pepper each piece, and
dip in a batter made of two eggs, half a cup of milk, and
<i>about</i> a cup of flour, or enough for thin batter. Fry in
hot lard or dripping to a fine brown; drain well, and
serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Slice six or eight cold boiled potatoes; put them into
a salad-dish, and season as follows: To two tablespoonfuls
of salad-oil add one teaspoonful of sugar, half as much,
each, of made mustard, salt, and pepper, and nearly as
much essence of celery. Rub to a smooth paste, and
whip in, a teaspoonful at a time, five tablespoonfuls of vinegar.
When well mixed, pour upon the salad.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Almond Custard, with Cocoanut Frost.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups fresh milk, with a pinch of soda stirred in; ½ lb.
almonds, blanched, dried, and pounded; 3 beaten eggs;
½ cup powdered sugar; rose-water; 1 cocoanut, pared,
thrown into cold water, and grated.</p>

<p>Scald the milk; stir in the almond-paste, which should
have been mixed with rose-water, to prevent oiling.
Boil one minute, and pour upon the beaten eggs and
sugar. Return to the fire, and stir until the mixture begins
to thicken. Take off, and pour into a bowl. When
cold, put on ice until Sunday. Then turn the custard
into a glass dish, and heap high with the grated cocoanut.
Strew powdered sugar over all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clam Soup.</span></h3>

<p>50 clams; 1 quart of hot water; 2 tablespoonfuls of
butter; 1 tablespoonful of flour; 1 teaspoonful chopped
onion, and same of mixed thyme and parsley; 2 cups of
hot milk; salt and cayenne; 2 blades of mace.</p>

<p>Cut the hard parts off from the clams, putting the soft
halves on ice. Strain off all the liquor, and put with the
hard bits over the fire, with a quart of hot water, the
onion, herbs, and mace. Simmer forty minutes. Heat
the milk in another vessel—not forgetting the pinch of
soda; stir in the butter, cut up in the flour, and set in
hot water until the soup is ready. At the end of the
forty minutes, strain the clam broth, leaving out the hard
parts. Put in the soft, season with salt and cayenne, and
let them <i>just</i> boil. Pour into the tureen, add the milk
and butter, and set the tureen in hot water five minutes
before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ragoût of Duck and Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the meat from the carcasses left since yesterday,
making the slices as neat as you can. If you have not a
<i>large</i> cupful of gravy left, make it by stewing down the
bones and stuffing in a quart of water, cooling, skimming,
and seasoning it. Put this in a saucepan with the pieces
of duck, and set where it will get very hot, but <i>not</i> boil.
Cook a quart of tender green peas in boiling water
twenty minutes; drain, and season them with pepper,
salt, and butter. Take out the duck and pile in the centre
of a dish; put the peas around it like a green hedge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
Boil up the gravy once when you have stirred in a little
browned flour, wet with cold water, and pour upon the
meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in two waters, and after draining off the last, cover,
barely, with boiling milk; stir in a good piece of butter
rolled in flour; season with salt and pepper; boil once,
and pour into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes, with Cheese Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>12 boiled potatoes, mashed soft with milk and butter;
4 tablespoonfuls of dry, grated cheese; 1 cup of rich
drawn butter; 2 beaten eggs; pepper, salt, and nutmeg;
triangles of fried bread; cracker-dust.</p>

<p>Stir into the hot drawn butter the pepper, salt, nutmeg,
beaten eggs, and half the cheese, and heat, stirring constantly,
until it thickens. Put a layer of potato upon a flat
stone-china dish—or a block-tin one—round it to suit the
shape of the dish, and cover with the sauce; this, in turn,
with a narrowing round of potatoes, but of equal thickness,
and this with sauce, and so on, until you have a mound
rounded on top. Coat with sauce, then with the rest of
the cheese and some pounded cracker. Lay the sippets
of fried bread up against it at the base, and heat to browning
in a quick oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Blackberries, Huckleberries, and Cream.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cake.</span></p>

<p>Put the blackberries in a dish of their own. Some persons
like them with cream, but more prefer to eat them
simply strewed with sugar. Wash the huckleberries, and
pass cream and sugar with them; then a basket of simple
cake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Summer Soup.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. coarse, lean beef, cut into strips; 1 lb. ham or
salt-pork bones; 4 quarts of water; 2 carrots; 2 turnips;
12 very small and young onions, minus the stalks; 1 cup
of strained tomato sauce; 1 cup of green peas; ½ cup of
green corn, cut from the cob; pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Cook the beef and bones in the water down to two
quarts of liquid. Strain, cool, and skim. Meanwhile
cut carrots and turnips into neat dice or strips, and parboil
with the onions five minutes in boiling water. Return
your skimmed and seasoned stock to the fire, and when
almost on the boil, put in the parboiled and drained vegetables,
with peas and corn. Simmer half an hour, add the
tomato sauce, and cook ten minutes more, then pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Collops.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of lean veal, cut into square bits, two inches across,
and more than half an inch thick; ¼ lb. fat salt pork, cut
into lardoons; 1 cup of gravy taken from your soup before
adding the vegetables; 1 cup of drawn butter; yolks
of 2 eggs; juice of half a lemon; pepper, salt, nutmeg,
and a pinch of mace.</p>

<p>Lard the veal with the pork, and lay in a pan of boiling
water three minutes. Have ready a cup of gravy seasoned
with nutmeg, pepper, salt, and lemon-peel. Put in the
meat, and simmer half an hour very gently. Beat the
yolks into the drawn butter; stir in the lemon-juice; add
to the contents of the saucepan, and stir, carefully, not to
break the lardoons, five minutes. Heap the collops into
a block upon a dish, and pour on the gravy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Peel, slice, and stew twenty minutes; then season with
pepper, salt, butter rolled in flour, and sugar. Simmer
five minutes, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off the ends; “string” well, paring both sides with
a keen knife; cut into short pieces, and cook in boiling
salt water forty minutes. Drain; salt, pepper, and stir
in a tablespoonful of butter, heated with a teaspoonful of
vinegar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Cucumbers.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, lay in ice-water one hour; slice, and mix with
pounded ice, in a glass bowl. Pass vinegar, salt, pepper,
and oil with them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Compote au Gratin.</span></h3>

<p>Make a quart of good apple sauce; rubbing it very
smooth, and beating in, while hot, sugar to make it quite
sweet, nutmeg, and a great spoonful of butter. Make a
heap of it (it should be rather stiff when cold) upon a
deep plate, or pie-dish. Wash all over with beaten egg,
and sift rolled cracker thickly upon it. Bake half an
hour, and eat hot with butter and sugar.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Noodle Soup.</span></h3>

<p>First—to borrow an idea from worthy Mrs. Glass—make
the noodles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>Take 4 eggs, beaten one minute; 3 tablespoonfuls of
water; enough flour (prepared) for stiff dough, and a
saltspoonful of salt. Make up, and knead fifteen minutes.
Roll into a thin sheet, and cut half of it into long strips,
less than half an inch wide, and these, again, across at intervals
of four inches. Now, roll the other half of the
sheet up very closely, making a long scroll like a quill.
Cut this across, with a keen knife, into little wheels less
than a quarter of an inch wide. Lay all in a sunny window
to dry. Those intended for to-day will be fit to use
in two hours. The rest will keep in a dry, cool place
several days, and can be used as a vegetable, or in soups.</p>

<p>Make a stock of 2 lbs. of beef bones, the same of mutton
bones and a slice of lean ham boiled in three quarts
of water, with 1 onion, 1 carrot, and a bunch of herbs
chopped. Boil down to two quarts, strain; cool, skim
and season, and put in a good handful of the noodles—a
few at a time—so soon as it boils. Simmer twenty minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Chickens and Tongue.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and truss the chickens; bind legs and
wings down closely by tying up the fowls in white, perfectly
clean bobbinet lace, or mosquito net. Put on in
plenty of boiling salted water and cook one hour, unless
they are large and tough. In that case cook <i>very</i> slowly
and long. Have ready a tongue, which has soaked several
hours in warm water—boiled, skimmed, and trimmed.
Lay upon a dish with a chicken on each side. Pour a
few spoonfuls of melted butter, heated, with a little
chopped parsley, over all three; set in a quick oven
three minutes; anoint again with the butter and parsley,
and send to table upon a hot, clean dish. Pass a boat of
drawn butter with them. Save the chicken liquor, well
seasoned, for to-morrow’s soup, also the water in which the
tongue was boiled. If it is a smoked tongue, you can use
the fat from the top for dripping. If corned, the liquor
can be added to soups and gravies.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Egg-plant.</span></h3>

<p>Please refer to Sunday of this week.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Shell and cook in boiling salted water about thirty minutes.
Drain, dish, and stir in salt, pepper, and a good
lump of butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Puffs.</span></h3>

<p>6 boiled potatoes, mashed soft, with a tablespoonful
of milk, and as much butter; 3 beaten eggs; 6 tablespoonfuls
of prepared flour, or enough to enable you to
make into soft dough. Make into balls like doughnuts;
roll these in flour, and fry to a fine brown in hot lard.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peaches and Cream.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and slice the peaches just before dinner, and cover
the glass dish containing them to exclude the air as much
as may be, since they soon change color. Do not sugar
them in the dish. They then become preserves—not
fresh fruit. Pass “fruit sugar” and cream with them.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken and Corn Soup.</span></h3>

<p>The pot-liquor from yesterday’s chickens; 12 ears of
corn, grated from the cob; 1 cup of milk; 1 tablespoonful
of butter, rolled in flour; pepper, salt, and parsley.</p>

<p>Take the fat from the top of your liquor, and save in the
dripping-pot. Heat the broth to a boil; put in the cobs
from which the corn has been cut, and cook half an hour.
Strain the soup; put again over the fire and put in the
cut corn. N. B.—It is well to split each row of grains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
before cutting them off. Cook forty minutes, stir in butter
and flour, with the parsley. Simmer five minutes, and
serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Game Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Cut away the under-side of a nice leg of mutton, to
make it as flat as may be without exposing the bone.
Put the pieces thus trimmed off over the fire, with a quart
of water, and stew down one-half. Cool, skim, season,
and re-heat. Meantime, lard the upper side of the meat
with slender lardoons.  If you have not a larding-needle—which
is a pity—use a long-bladed jack-knife to make
diagonal incisions in the mutton; then thrust in the lardoons
with your fingers, bringing both ends to the surface.
Now rub the meat all over with hot butter and vinegar,
letting the surplus trickle into the dripping-pan. Pour
the boiling pint of gravy over the leg, and roast twelve
minutes to the pound, basting every ten minutes, copiously.
Just before taking it up, pour off the fat from the
gravy; dip up a few spoonfuls of the brown juice, and,
mixing with as much currant jelly, beat in a little browned
flour, wet up with cold water. Baste the meat with this
until a fine brown glaze covers it. Serve the gravy, well
skimmed, in a boat. This is a delightful dish. Carve
judiciously, so as to leave a seemly joint cold for to-morrow.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sister Anne’s Soup.</span></h3>

<p>12 potatoes, pared and quartered; 1 onion, sliced;
tablespoonful of minced parsley; 1 cup of unskimmed
milk (cream is still better); 2 tablespoonfuls of butter;
1 tablespoonful of corn-starch, wet with cold milk; 1 teaspoonful
of sugar; 2 quarts of boiling water; pinch of
soda in the milk.</p>

<p>Parboil the potatoes ten minutes; throw off the water,
and put on two quarts of boiling water. Cook in this
one hour with the onion, replenishing from the kettle as
it boils away. Then rub through a fine colander, season
with pepper, salt, and parsley, and re-heat. When it bubbles
up, stir in the butter and corn-starch; boil up, add
the hot milk, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Bass.</span></h3>

<p>Put enough water in the pot for the fish to swim in,
easily. Add half a cup of vinegar, a teaspoonful of salt,
an onion, a dozen black peppers, and a blade of mace.
Sew up the fish in a piece of clean net, fitted to its shape.
Heat slowly for the first half hour, then boil eight minutes,
at least, to the pound, quite fast. Unwrap, and
pour over it a cup of drawn butter, based upon the liquor
in which the fish was boiled, with the juice of half a lemon
stirred into it. Garnish with sliced lemon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Put on the larded joint, cold, garnished with nasturtium
flowers and curled parsley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Peel with a sharp knife. Slice, arrange in a salad-dish,
and pour over it a dressing such as you made for potato
salad on Sunday of this week.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Corn Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>12 ears of sweet corn, each row of grains split lengthwise,
then cut close to the cob; 4 eggs; 2 cups of milk;
1 tablespoonful of sugar, rubbed up with one of butter;
1 teaspoonful of salt; 2 tablespoonfuls of flour.</p>

<p>Mix as you would a rice pudding, and bake one hour in
a buttered dish. Serve in the bake-dish, hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Custard Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Make a <i>very</i> sweet apple sauce in which not a lump
remains. To each cupful add two eggs beaten light and
half a cupful of perfectly fresh milk. Have ready some
paste-shells in pie-plates, fill with the custard and bake at
once without an upper crust.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pot au Feu.</span></h3>

<p>5 lbs. of brisket of beef—bones cracked, and meat
sliced; the broken bones of your cold mutton, after you
have sliced off the meat; 2 grated carrots; 2 grated turnips;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
1 large fried onion; bunch of sweet herbs; 1
whole carrot; 1 whole turnip, cut into dice; 1 very small
cauliflower, the bunches clipped apart; 6 quarts of water;
pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Put on the meat, bones, onion, grated vegetables and
herbs in the soup-pot with the water; cover closely and
cook slowly five hours. Then strain; take out the meat
and set aside with half the stock, well seasoned, for Sunday.
Put on the ice when cold. Cool and skim the
rest; season; put back in the pot with a parboiled turnip,
carrot, and cauliflower, the latter clipped into small
clusters; the others cut into dice. Simmer half an hour,
and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Ham and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Cut slices of cooked ham of equal size; broil upon a
gridiron over a clear fire. Lay upon a hot dish; pepper,
and spread each slice with a mixture of melted butter and
a very little made mustard. Lay on each a poached egg,
trimmed neatly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Casserole of Potato.</span></h3>

<p>Mash eight or ten potatoes smooth with butter, salt,
and work in the beaten whites of two eggs. Then fill a
greased jelly-mould with it, pressing down firmly. Set
aside to harden. When cold, scoop out about a teacupful,
or less, from the middle, leaving firm, thick walls.
Fill the cavity with a mince of cold mutton, highly
seasoned, mixed with crumbs and moistened with gravy,
and not too soft. Fit a piece of fried bread in the mouth
of the filled cavity; turn out the casserole carefully upon
a stone-china or block-tin dish; wash all over with beaten
egg and set in a hot oven ten minutes to heat and glaze.
The mince should be very hot when it goes in and stiff
enough to keep its shape.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>See Tuesday of this week.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Boil and mash as usual; then return to the saucepan
with half a cup of milk to a quart of mashed squash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
and when this simmers, stir in a tablespoonful of butter
rolled in flour; pepper and salt to taste. Stir three minutes
and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jelly Omelette.</span></h3>

<p>Beat six eggs light—yolks and whites separately; then
mix them and stir in lightly a tablespoonful of powdered
sugar. Put a tablespoonful of butter into a frying-pan,
and, when it boils, pour in the omelette. Lift at the
edges and bottom with your spatula, as it cooks, and
when “set” in the middle, put on one side of it a few
spoonfuls of fruit-jelly; fold over, and turn out upon a
hot dish. Strew powdered sugar over it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Noodle Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the top of your cold stock; put the
latter in a soup-pot; heat to a gentle boil. Strain through
thin muslin; set again over the fire; boil and skim one
minute; add nearly a cupful of dried noodles and simmer
twenty minutes. If you have no noodles made, break a
handful of vermicelli small, and cook the same length of
time.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Braised Chicken.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and stuff a pair of fowls. Lay slices of
fat salt pork in a broad saucepan, and upon these the
chickens with thin slices of pork tied over their breasts.
Put two cupfuls of hot water in the pan, cover very
securely and cook slowly an hour and a half—longer
should the chickens be tough—and this is a good way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
cook such. At the end of that time remove the chicken
to the hot-water dish; cover to keep hot; strain the
gravy and return half to a small saucepan. Add a little
browned flour wet with cold water, and boil fast to a
bright brown glaze. Put the fowls in a quick oven; take
off the pork; brush all over with the glaze, and when
brown, serve. Take the fat from the reserved gravy, add
the water in which the giblets were boiled; the chopped
giblets themselves, and a little browned flour, also pepper.
Boil up and serve in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Egg-plant.</span></h3>

<p>Please see Sunday of First Week in August.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Corn Sauté.</span></h3>

<p>Boil; then cut from the cob; have ready in a saucepan
a little butter, seasoned with salt and pepper. Stir
in the corn and shake and toss until hot and glazed with
the butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare with a sharp knife; cut in thick slices. Put a
layer of crumbs in the bottom of a bake-dish; wet them
with a little of your soup-stock, or other gravy; cover
with tomatoes, seasoned with butter, salt, pepper and
sugar, more crumbs moistened with gravy, and so on, to
the top of the dish, having well-moistened crumbs for the
last layer. Cover, and bake half an hour; then uncover
and brown quickly. Serve in the bake-dish.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Monday Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Strip all the meat from your chicken-bones, and set in
a cool place, while you break the skeletons to pieces, and
put in a soup-pot at the back of the range, with the dressing,
skin, and gristly bits. Pour on three quarts of water
and leave it to simmer—always covered—for three hours.
Strain, rubbing the stuffing through the colander; cool
and skim; return to the fire with a cupful of yesterday’s
soup (there is always a <i>little</i> left over, if it is only saved
from the swill-pail), also strained. Have ready six Boston
crackers split and dried in the oven for half an hour, but
not scorched. Butter these; lay in the heated tureen;
pour upon them two cups of boiling milk, and let soak,
covered, while you salt and pepper your soup, and add
a little minced parsley. Should there not be dressing
enough to thicken it well, stir in a little corn-starch, wet
with milk. Boil up, and pour upon the crackers. This
soup need not consume fifteen minutes of your time, and
is very savory.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scallop and Baked Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Mince your chicken, but not small; cover the bottom
of a pudding-dish with fine crumbs; put in the chicken,
wet with gravy and seasoned to taste; strew a good coating
of crumbs on top, and this with butter-bits. Set, covered,
in the oven. When the gravy bubbles to the surface
remove the lid and break upon the scallop enough eggs to
cover it well. Pepper and salt; lay a piece of butter on
each, and bake until well “set.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, mash, and whip to a cream with a fork, mixing in
butter, milk, salt and a dust of pepper, as you go on.
Serve in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>See Sunday of First Week in August.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Cucumbers.</span></h3>

<p>Pare; lay in ice-water one hour; slice and pile upon
pounded ice in a glass dish, sending around condiments
with them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Huckleberry Cake.</span></h3>

<p>This cake should have been made on Saturday. It
keeps well, and is much better the second day than the
first.</p>

<p>5 eggs; 3 cups of powdered sugar; 1 cup of butter; 1
cup of sweet milk; 4 cups of prepared flour; 1 teaspoonful
mixed nutmeg and cinnamon; 2 cups of huckleberries
dredged with flour; ¼ teaspoonful of soda stirred in
boiling water and mixed with the milk.</p>

<p>Cream butter and sugar; add the beaten yolks, the
milk, the flour, alternately, with the whipped whites, and,
lastly, the dredged berries. Bake in small loaves, or in
patty-pans, in a moderate oven, covering as it begins to
brown. It takes a longer time to bake than plain cake.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Iced Coffee.</span></h3>

<p>Make more coffee than needed for breakfast. Set by
three or four cups of strong coffee, adding nearly one-third
as much boiled milk, while both are hot. Set in ice,
and, in serving, put a lump of ice in each glass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tapioca Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 lbs. lean veal; 2 lbs. beef-bones, cracked; 1 slice of
corned ham; 1 carrot; bunch of herbs; 1 onion; 8 large
tomatoes; 1 tablespoonful of sugar; pepper and salt;
¼ cup granulated tapioca, previously soaked two hours in
a little cold water; 3 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Slice the meat and vegetables, and put on—leaving out
the tomatoes—in the water, to boil slowly four hours.
At the end of the second hour, skim well, and add the
tomatoes. When the time is up, strain the soup, take out
the meat, and rub the vegetables through the colander.
Cool and skim; season with sugar, pepper, salt, and
minced herbs, and heat up anew. When it boils, add the
tapioca; stir clear, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak.</span></h3>

<p>Flatten with the broad side of a hatchet, and broil upon
a buttered gridiron over a clear fire. Lay upon a hot
dish, pepper, salt, and put a bountiful spoonful of butter,
cut into bits, upon it. Cover with a hot dish or lid for
five minutes before it is to be carved.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomatoes and Corn, Stewed.</span></h3>

<p>Slice eight large tomatoes, when you have skinned
them. Add the corn cut from six ears; put into a saucepan
and stew twenty minutes; season with pepper, salt,
and sugar. Add a great lump of butter rolled in flour,
and cook ten minutes longer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes in Jackets.</span></h3>

a napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Squash.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Soup.</span></h3>

<p>The liquor in which your calf’s head was boiled; 1
onion; bunch of parsley; 1 blade of mace; 1 cup of
milk; yolks of 2 eggs; pepper and salt; 1 teaspoonful
corn-starch, rubbed in cold water.</p>

<p>Boil your calf’s head early in the day, until you can just
handle it without breaking it to pieces. It will be firmer
for baking if left to get cold at this juncture. Skim the
pot-liquor, put in the sliced onion, parsley, and mace,
and boil slowly two hours. Strain, cool, skim, season,
and thicken slightly with the corn-starch. Beat the yolks
in a bowl, add the boiling milk, and pour into the heated
tureen. Add the soup, stir up well, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Calf’s Head, with Mushrooms.</span></h3>

<p>Set the cold boiled calf’s head in the oven; pour a cup
of pot-liquor, boiling hot, over it, and bake half an hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
basting very often. Then dredge well with flour and
baste twice with butter. Now coat thickly with a paste
made of the brains, boiled, cooled and beaten smooth with
an egg, and seasoned with pepper and salt. When this
has browned, dish the head. Strain the gravy, add half a
cupful of mushrooms, boiled and chopped, a very little
browned flour, the juice of a lemon, and, if needed, a little
boiling water. Stew one minute and send up in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in hot water, a little salt, about twenty minutes.
Drain and press; then chop very fine and return to the
fire with a good lump of butter, salt, pepper, sugar, a few
tablespoonfuls of cream, and beat to a smooth mixture
like custard. Pour into a deep dish and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Succotash.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the corn from six or seven cobs; mix with it one-third
the quantity of Lima beans; just cover with water,
and stew gently half an hour. Turn off most of the water,
add a cup of milk, and when this heats, a great lump of
butter rolled in flour, with pepper and salt. Simmer half
an hour longer, stirring up often.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce.</span></h3>

<p>Pick apart the heads and pile upon pounded ice, on a
glass dish. Pass vinegar, pepper, salt, and powdered sugar
with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Sliced tart apples; bread-crumbs; butter; sugar; cinnamon.</p>

<p>Butter a pudding-dish very well, and put in a layer of
crumbs; then dots of butter; next, sliced apples strewed
with sugar and cinnamon—more buttered crumbs. Repeat
the layers in this order until your dish is full, with
crumbs on top. Bake, covered, half an hour—or forty
minutes for a large dish. Turn out, pour liquid sauce
over it, and eat hot with more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Bouillon.</span></h3>

<p>6 lbs. of round of beef, bound into a good shape with
tape; 3 small carrots; 3 turnips; 8 very small young
onions, and one large one stuck with four cloves. Bunch
of herbs; 1 pint of string-beans and same of green peas;
1 small head of cauliflower; 4 quarts of water; pepper
and salt; noodles, rice or sago.</p>

<p>Put the beef whole into the water, and heat slowly to a
boil. When you have taken off the scum, dip out a pint
of the liquor, and put by for cooking the vegetables. Add
to the liquor left with the beef one sliced carrot, one turnip,
also sliced, the large onion and the herbs. Stew
slowly four hours; take out the beef and keep hot over
boiling water. Strain the soup, pulping the vegetables;
cool and skim, return to the fire, and, when it heats, add
noodles, boiled rice or soaked German sago. Simmer
five minutes and pour into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Beef and Vegetables.</span></h3>

<p>Pare the two turnips and two carrots; string the beans;
top, tail and skin the onions, and cook these, with the
cauliflower, half an hour in the pint of hot broth, slightly
salted. Then add the peas, and cook twenty minutes
more. Serve the beef upon a hot dish; slice the turnips
and carrots and clip the cauliflower into bunches, and lay,
each kind of vegetable by itself, about the meat. Make
a sauce by heating and skimming a cupful of the soup-broth,
stirring into it a great spoonful of butter rolled in a
heaping teaspoonful of flour, and, when it has thickened,
seasoning with pepper, salt, a little French mustard, and
the juice of half a lemon. Serve in a boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Eel Soup.</span></h3>

<p>4 lbs. of eels; 3 quarts of water; 1 chopped onion;
minced parsley; a blade of mace; pepper, salt, and
lemon-juice; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter rolled in flour;
dripping.</p>

<p>Clean the eels, removing all the fat, and cut into short
pieces. Fry a chopped onion brown in plenty of dripping;
wipe the eels dry and fry them in the same. Put into a
pot with the onion and mace; cover with three quarts of
cold water, and stew slowly two hours. Then season;
stir in the floured butter; simmer three minutes, add the
lemon-juice, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Chickens.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash off the blood, but do not soak; split down
the backs, and lay upon a gridiron, or sticks laid over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>

Wipe off the moisture lightly, and cook upon a buttered
gridiron over hot coals, turning when it drips. Let it get
tender and brown without scorching. When done, lay
upon a hot dish; butter well, pepper and salt, and send
up at once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Slice fine ripe tomatoes without peeling them, and cook,
held between the wires of an oyster-broiler, until hissing
hot and slightly browned. Lay upon a hot dish, and dress

<p>Mash in the usual way; put upon a layer of crumbs
laid in the bottom of a pudding-dish, having seasoned the
squash with butter, pepper, and salt. Pour a little cream
on top, and strew with buttered crumbs. Bake, covered,
half an hour, then brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nutmeg and Water Melons.</span></h3>

<p>Keep both on ice for several hours. Serve, by wiping
the watermelon and laying it whole upon a long dish, to
be carved at table. If cut up too long before it is to be
eaten, it becomes insipid. Cut the nutmeg melons in two;
take out the seeds, and put a lump of ice in each half.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Vegetable Soup with Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of beef—coarse and cut into strips; 2 lbs. veal,
from the scrag; 2 lbs. marrow-bones of any kind; 2 carrots;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
1 turnip; 1 large onion; 6 tomatoes; corn from
three ears, <i>grated</i> off; 1 pint of green peas; sweet herbs;
pepper and salt; 6 quarts of water; 6 or 8 eggs.</p>

<p>Put the meat, bones, and all the vegetables on in the
water, early in the day, and boil slowly five or six hours.
Should the liquid sink more than one-third, add boiling
water. The meat should be in rags, and the vegetables
broken to pieces. Strain; pulp the vegetables through
the colander; cool, and skim the stock, and season well.
Divide, and set aside a goodly portion for Sunday, keeping
it on ice. Boil up, skim again, pour into the tureen,
and lay on the surface the poached <i>yolks</i> of as many eggs
as there are people to be served. Use the whites for
white, silver, or lady cake.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Mutton Chops.</span></h3>

<p>Trim off all the fat and skin, leaving a bare piece of bone
at the end of each. Lard closely with fat salt pork, passing
the lardoons quite through the meat. Put on in a saucepan,
with enough gravy to cover them, and what remains of
your can of mushrooms from day before yesterday. They
will have kept well on ice. Cut each mushroom in two.
Cover, and simmer gently until the chops are tender. (The
gravy should be cold when it is poured upon them.) Take
up the chops; arrange upon a dish. Add a heaping teaspoonful
of currant jelly and a little browned flour to the
gravy, boil once, and pour over the meat. Garnish with
sliced lemon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Peas.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Green Corn.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes Boiled Whole.</span></h3>

<p>Treat as directed on Tuesday of this week, only stripping
off the skins after they are boiled, and, when they are
dished, dressing them with hot butter mixed with minced
parsley and pepper and salt. Serve very hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Blackberry Roley Poley.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of prepared flour; 1 heaping tablespoonful of
lard; and the same of butter, rubbed with a little salt,
into the flour; enough milk—about two cups—to make
soft dough.</p>

<p>Roll out into a sheet a quarter of an inch thick. Strew,
leaving a narrow margin at the sides, with sound blackberries,
sprinkled with sugar. Roll tightly. Sew up with
a “felled” seam, in a cloth, leaving room for swelling.
Put into a pot of boiling water, and keep at the boil an
hour and a quarter. Dip the cloth in cold water to
loosen it, and turn out. Eat cold with hard sauce.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the top of your soup-stock; heat,
and add a pint of strained tomato sauce well seasoned.
Simmer ten minutes, and it is ready.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fillet of Veal.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, blanch, and chop two sweetbreads; mix with them a
slice of cooked corned ham, minced, and some fine bread-crumbs;
season with pepper, salt, a pinch of lemon-peel,
and bind with a beaten egg. Stuff a fillet of veal with this
mixture. Bind a broad strip of muslin about it, as wide
as the meat is high; set in a dripping-pan, and pour a cup
of hot water around it. Cover the top with milk in which
has been mixed a tablespoonful of melted butter. Pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
on carefully so as not to run down the sides. Bake, basting
for one hour with milk and butter, for another hour
with <i>cream</i>, in which has been stirred a pinch of soda.
Unbind the muslin from the fillet, dish it; add to the
gravy a little hot water and a teaspoonful of corn-starch
wet in cold water; boil up, and pour half upon the veal,
the rest into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chopped Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Chop cold, boiled potatoes into rather coarse dice;
cover with warm milk in which a pinch of soda has been
dropped; when very hot, stir in a lump of floured butter
and a little minced parsley and onion. Simmer five minutes
and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Corn Pudding.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Lèche-Crêma.</span></h3>

<p>12 ripe peaches, pared, stoned and cut in halves; 3
eggs, and the whites of 2 more; ½ cup of powdered sugar;
2 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch wet in cold milk; 1 tablespoonful
melted butter; 1 pint of milk.</p>

<p>Scald the milk, stir in the corn-starch, and, when it
begins to thicken, take from the fire and put in the butter.
When lukewarm, whip in the beaten yolks until all
are very light. Put a thick substratum of peaches into a
dish; strew with sugar, and pour the creamy compound
over them. Bake in a quick oven ten minutes and
spread with a <i>méringue</i> made of five whites whipped stiff
with a little powdered sugar. Shut the oven-door until
this is firm. Eat cold with cream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Quick Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 lbs. of raw lean beef, chopped <i>very</i> fine; 3 pints of
boiling water in which an onion, a turnip, and a carrot—all
pared and sliced—have been boiled twenty minutes;
pepper, salt, and a tablespoonful of tomato catsup.</p>

<p>Put the beef into a tin pail and set in cold water.
Bring this slowly to a boil, then pour in the boiling water
upon the smoking hot meat inside. Cover closely, boil
for half an hour in the hot water; turn into a saucepan;
season, simmer ten minutes, strain, pressing and wringing
the meat, and pour into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dijon Paté.</span></h3>

<p>1 large cup of cold boiled rice; 2 raw eggs; ½ cup of
milk; 2 cups of minced veal; ½ cupful of gravy or drawn
butter; 4 hard boiled eggs, sliced; pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Butter a pudding-mould—one without a cylinder—and
line it with a thick coating of the rice worked to a paste
with the milk and beaten eggs, and seasoned with pepper
and salt. The paste should be quite stiff. Line the inside
of this in turn with the sliced eggs, and within this
pack the minced veal, wet with gravy and seasoned to
taste. The stuffing of the fillet of veal should be chopped
with the meat. Cover with rice; put on the lid of the
mould; set it in boiling water and cook one hour. Turn
out carefully, and serve with a good gravy in a boat.
The gravy, if you have no other, can be made of odds-and-ends
of the veal boiled down in water. Or a cup of
your tomato soup of yesterday will make a good sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Broth.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of lean mutton; 2 turnips; 1 carrot; 2 onions;
bunch of parsley; 1 cup of milk; 1 tablespoonful of corn-starch;
3 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Boil meat, cut into strips, and the vegetables, sliced, in
the water two hours and a half. The water should be reduced
one-third. Strain, taking out the meat, and rubbing
the vegetables to a pulp through the colander.
Cool, skim, season, and return to the fire. Heat, stir in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
the corn-starch wet up with water, and pour into the
tureen. Add the milk, boiling hot, stir well, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brunswick Stew.</span></h3>

<p>3 fine gray squirrels, skinned and cleaned—joint as you
would chickens for a fricassee; ½ lb. of fat salt pork; 1
onion, sliced; 12 ears of corn cut from the cob; 6 large
tomatoes, pared and sliced; 3 tablespoonfuls of butter
rolled in flour; parsley; enough water to cover the squirrels.</p>

<p>Put on squirrels, pork—cut up small—onion, and parsley
in the water, and bring to a boil. When this has
lasted ten minutes, put in the corn, and stew until the
squirrels are tender. Then add the tomatoes, cut up thin.
Twenty minutes later, stir in the butter and flour. Simmer
ten minutes, and pour into a large, deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Onions Stewed Brown.</span></h3>

<p>10 or 12 small onions; 1 cup of gravy from your soup,
before it is strained; seasoning.</p>

<p>Top, tail, and skin the onions. Parboil for ten minutes;
throw off the water, and cover with the cooled and
skimmed gravy. Season, and stew until the onions are
tender. Then stir in a tablespoonful of butter rubbed up
with browned flour. Simmer five minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Duchesse.</span></h3>

<p>Work a beaten egg and a little butter into each cup of
mashed potatoes; put a tablespoonful of butter into a
saucepan, and stir and turn the potato in it until very hot.
Do not let it “catch” on the sides. Turn out, and
mould in greased muffin-rings. Leave it to cool in these;
then loosen gently upon a greased baking-pan, and bake
until delicately browned.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ox-cheek Soup.</span></h3>

<p>The meat from the cheeks of an ox-head; 2 sliced
onions, fried brown; sweet herbs; 1 small cup of rice;
1 teaspoonful of curry-powder; 3 quarts of water; pepper
and salt; bones of the head.</p>

<p>Cut the meat very small; put with the fried onions
and bones into a pot, and pour on the water. Stew
slowly three hours. Strain, cool, skim; put in seasoning,
herbs, and the rice, previously soaked two hours. Stew
half an hour; add the curry-powder, wet in cold water;
boil up, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Lay a neat cut of rib-roast, trimmed and skewered, in
a dripping-pan; dash a cupful of boiling water all over it,
and roast ten minutes to the pound, if you like it rare.
Just before taking it up, baste it with butter—the previous
and abundant bastings should have been with its own
gravy—dredge with flour, and, as it browns, again with
butter. Pour off the fat from the gravy before thickening
and seasoning it. Much of the so-called beef gravy is
only fit for the dripping-pot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, quarter, seed, and boil in hot, salted water.
Drain, and mash in a hot colander; season with pepper,
salt, and butter, and dish hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Corn cut from the Cob.</span></h3>

<p>After boiling, cut the corn, with a sharp knife, from the
cob, into a hot dish; stir in butter, pepper, and salt, and
cover to keep hot until eaten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span></p>

<p>12 juicy, tart apples; 1 cup of sugar; grated peel of a
lemon; 1 pint of milk; 3 eggs, and 3 tablespoonfuls of
sugar, for the custard; good pie-paste.</p>

<p>Put a border of pie-crust around the flat brim of a pie-plate,
without lining the bottom. Fill the plate with
sliced apple, sugared, with lemon-peel scattered here and
there. Put in a <i>little</i> water. Cover with a crust, in the
centre of which you have marked a circle with a cake-cutter,
or large tumbler. Bake the pie; with a sharp
knife, cut out the marked circle, lift the centre-piece,
and fill the inside of the pie with a warm custard made of
the milk, eggs, and sugar, boiled until it begins to thicken.
Eat cold.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.’s Corn Soup.</span></h3>

<p>15 ears of corn, grated from the cob as close as the
grater will take off the grains; the bones and other “trimmings”
of yesterday’s roast beef, both raw and cooked;
1 onion; 1 cup of milk; 2 great spoonfuls of butter,
rolled in flour; pepper and salt; 3 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Put the empty cobs, the bones, etc., with the onion, on
in the water, and stew two hours. Strain off the water,
and put the grated corn into it with pepper and salt.
Stew gently one hour; add the floured butter; simmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
ten minutes, and pour into the tureen. Add the milk,
boiling hot; stir up and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Smothered Chicken.</span></h3>

<p>Split a pair of young, but well-grown chickens down
the back, as for broiling. Lay flat in a dripping-pan;
pour a cup of boiling water over them, and invert another
pan over them so as to cover closely. Roast half an
hour, and baste very freely with butter and water. Ten
minutes later baste with gravy from the pan. In five
more, with melted butter, profusely. Bake until the fowls
are tender and well colored. Dish, salt and pepper them;
thicken and season the gravy; pour some over the chickens
and send up the rest in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Choose large, smooth tomatoes; cut a piece from the
top of each; take out the inside, taking care not to cut
the skin. Chop up the tomato-pulp with a little cold
beef; add one-fourth as much bread-crumbs as you have
pulp, and wet all with beef-gravy, seasoning with a little
sugar, pepper, and salt. Fill the tomatoes with this
force-meat; put on the top slices; pack the stuffing that
remains between the tomatoes, and pour gravy upon this;
cover and bake from forty to forty-five minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups of mashed potatoes; 3 tablespoonfuls of cream;
2 tablespoonfuls of butter; yolks of 4 hard-boiled eggs,
1 raw beaten egg; handful fine crumbs; pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Beat up the hot potatoes light with butter, cream, raw
egg and seasoning. Put a layer in the bottom of a bake-dish;
cover with thin slices of yolk; salt and pepper;
put on more potato, and go on thus until the dish is full.
Cover the top layer of potato with crumbs, and bake,
covered, half an hour, then brown quickly. Serve in the
bake-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beets.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off the tops, taking care not to scratch the skins.
Boil at least one hour in hot salted water; scrape and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
slice. Put into a deep dish and season with a few spoonfuls
of hot water mixed with as much vinegar and a little
pepper and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cottage Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup of milk; 1 tablespoonful of butter rubbed in a
cup of sugar; 2 eggs; 3 cups of prepared flour; a little
salt.</p>

<p>Beat the yolks into the butter and sugar; add the milk,
then the flour, alternately with the whisked whites. Bake
in a cake-mould; turn out hot upon a plate, cut in slices,
and eat with sweet sauce.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fish Chowder.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of cod, or halibut, or any other firm white fish;
8 potatoes, sliced and parboiled; 1 sliced onion, large;
½ lb. fat salt pork, cut into dice; 2 cups of boiling milk,
with a pinch of soda stirred in; 6 Boston crackers, split
and buttered thickly; chopped parsley, pepper, and salt
to taste; 1 lemon, pared and cut into thin slices; claret.</p>

<p>Fry the pork in its own fat; add the onions, and, when
they are brown, drain from the fat. Put a layer of pork
into the soup pot; then, one of potatoes, peppered;
next, fish, onions, more pork, and so on. Pour in a glass
of claret, then just enough boiling water to cover all.
Stew gently half an hour. Line the tureen with buttered
crackers; pour on the boiling milk, and set the tureen in
boiling water until the chowder is done. Just before

<h3><span class="smcap">White Mock Turtle Soup.</span></h3>

<p>1 calf’s head, cleaned with the skin on; ½ lb. lean ham,
cut into strips; 1 carrot; 1 onion; 1 turnip; bunch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
sweet herbs; 4 tablespoonfuls of flour and the same of
butter; 1 cup of milk; 6 quarts of water; pepper and
salt.</p>

<p>Boil the head in the water with the ham, onion, turnip,
and carrot sliced, and the chopped herbs. Cover, and
stew slowly until the bones fall from the meat. Take out
the head; return the bones to the soup. Divide the meat
into two portions; set by one to cool for present use;
put the other, highly seasoned, into a large bowl, and strain
half the stock over it. When cool, set on the ice for to-morrow.
Chop the calf’s ears, and the less desirable parts
of the meat reserved for to-day, fine, and put back upon
the bones in the soup. Boil gently half an hour. Meantime,
put the butter into a frying-pan, and when hot, stir
in the flour. It must not get at all brown. When it is
again bubbling hot, stir in a cupful of the soup; boil one
minute, and pour it out to cool. Strain your soup; stir
in the cooled mixture; boil up and skim, when you have
seasoned quite highly; put in three or four handfuls of
meat-dice cut up from the fat, gelatinous parts of the cold
head; simmer to a boil; pour into the tureen, add the
milk, boiling hot, and send to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Liver and Bacon.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of fresh liver; 1 lb. of streaked bacon; juice of a
lemon; 1 tablespoonful of flour, and same of butter; pepper,
salt, and onion.</p>

<p>Soak the liver in cold water fifteen minutes; wipe dry,
and cut in strips an inch wide, and three long. Cut as
many thinner strips of bacon, and fry these three minutes
in their own fat; take out and keep hot while you fry an
onion—sliced—with the liver in the same fat. Salt, pepper,
and dredge the liver in flour before it goes in. When
it is done lay in two rows, the length of the dish, with a
strip of bacon between each piece and the next. Strain
the fat, and return to the pan with a cupful of hot water,
the butter rubbed into the flour, and, when it has boiled
up, the juice of a lemon. Pour over the liver. Pass
mustard with this dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breaded Egg-plant.</span></h3>

<p>Slice half an inch thick, and lay in salt and water one
hour, with a heavy plate on top to keep them under.
Then wipe dry, dip in beaten egg, roll in cracker-crumbs,
and fry in hot lard or dripping. Drain, pepper and salt
them, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Be doubly careful, as the season advances, to pare off
the toughening fibres on both sides. Cut in short pieces;
boil in hot salted water forty minutes, drain, pepper, salt,
and butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn and Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>8 large tomatoes, pared and sliced thin; 6 ears of corn,
the grains <i>shaved</i> from the cob by successive strokes of a
keen knife; sugar, pepper, salt, and butter.</p>

<p>Put corn and tomatoes together, and cook forty minutes.
Season, and simmer ten minutes more. Pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nutmeg Melons and Peaches.</span></h3>

<p>Halve the melons, take out the seeds, and put a piece
of ice in each half. Pile the peaches in a fruit-dish, or
basket, with green leaves between.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clear Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from your soup-jelly; pour into a pot and
heat until you can strain it off from the meat. Cut up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
latter; season with salt and a little spice, and put back
on the ice. There is still gelatine enough in it to make
it valuable. Boil and skim your soup two or three minutes,
and add a small cup of German sago which has been
soaked in a little water one hour. When clear, serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Ducks.</span></h3>

<p>After cleaning and washing, lard the breasts of a pair
of ducks with narrow strips of bacon. You <i>must</i> have a
larding-needle for this, since both ends of the lardoons
must project upon the same surface. Half roast the
ducks; put on in a saucepan, with two cups of broth
made by abstracting a cup of jelly from your soup-stock,
thinning it with boiling water and seasoning it. Add a
chopped onion and a glass of claret. Stew half an hour,
or until tender; dish; take the fat from the gravy, thicken,
boil and pour half over the ducks, the rest into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Succotash.</span></h3>

<p>8 ears of corn—the grains cut off; about a pint of
Lima beans; 1 tablespoonful of floured butter; pepper
and salt; 1 cup of milk.</p>

<p>Boil corn and beans for nearly an hour in enough boiling
water to cover them. Turn this off, add the milk;
when this heats, butter, pepper and salt. Simmer ten
minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, seed, quarter, and cook soft in boiling salted water.
Pour this off, and add a few tablespoonfuls of strained
gravy from your ducks—or any other you may have.
Beat the squash to pieces in this, in the saucepan; season
well and stir until as stiff and smooth as apple sauce;
then dish upon crustless slices of fried bread.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>See Saturday, Second Week in August.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Ice-Cream.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of rich milk and as much sweet cream; 4 cups
of sugar; 6 eggs; 1 quart of very ripe peaches pared and
cut small.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>Make as directed in full on Sunday of Second Week in
July; but stir in the peaches just before closing the freezer
for the second time, beating them well into the congealing
cream. Unless they are very sweet, you would do well to
dredge them in sugar before they go in.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Medley Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Cut up the cold calf’s head—or the remains of it set by
for the second time on yesterday—into dice. Save half
to be added as a final touch to your soup. Put the rest
with the skeleton of your ducks into the soup-pot, and
cover with three quarts of water. When it has simmered
three hours and boiled down one-third, strain and return
to the fire, with half a cup of green peas, and the same of
tomato-sauce—or you can put in, if more convenient, the
remnants of the succotash and squash left from Sunday’s
dinner. If you use the raw peas, simmer half an hour;
if the cooked vegetables, but ten minutes. Add the meat-dice,
boil up once, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Casserole of Ducks and Macaroni.</span></h3>

<p>Make according to directions given for “Dijon Paté,”
on Monday of Third Week in August, substituting macaroni
boiled twenty minutes in hot salted water, then cut
into quarter-inch lengths, for the boiled rice, and minced
duck for the veal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Cut smooth slices of cooked ham, and broil five minutes
over—or under—clear coals. Pepper and butter
each, and give also a mere touch of French mustard.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Top, tail, and skin the onions. Cook twenty minutes
in boiling water; throw this off, and cover with milk.
Simmer ten minutes, or until tender; stir in a lump of
floured butter, season with pepper and salt; cook two
minutes, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chopped Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Chop coarsely cold boiled potatoes. Have ready in a
saucepan a little good dripping, well flavored. As it heats,
put in the potatoes, and stir until smoking hot all through.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Watermelons and Pears.</span></h3>

<p>Keep the watermelons on ice for some hours before you
send them to table. Lay upon a large flat dish, and serve
the pears in a fruit-dish or basket.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Farina Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 lbs. of lean coarse beef; 2 lbs. of mutton-bones; 1
onion; 1 grated carrot, and 1 grated turnip; bunch of
herbs; pepper and salt; ½ cup of farina, soaked two
hours in a cup of milk; 3 qts. of water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span></p>

<p>Crack the bones and chop the meat and onion. Put
these on with the other vegetables, the herbs, and water,
and boil slowly three or four hours. Strain, cool, skim
and season. Put in the farina with a pinch of soda, and
simmer half an hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Haricot of Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of lean mutton; 1 onion; 1 cup of gravy taken
from your soup; 1 dessertspoonful of tomato catsup; 1
carrot; 1 cup of green peas; 1 glass of sherry; 2 spoonfuls
of butter; browned flour for thickening the gravy;
pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Cut the mutton into strips three inches long by one
wide, and fry these, with the sliced onion, in the butter.
Have ready the gravy in a saucepan, and put in the meat.
Stew slowly nearly an hour. Then add the carrot, parboiled
and sliced, and the peas. Stew twenty minutes;
thicken the butter used for frying with browned flour, add
pepper, salt, and the catsup; pour into the stew, and
cook three minutes. Add the wine; boil up, and serve
in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Moulded Potato.</span></h3>

<p>Mash the potato smooth, working in a little milk, butter,
and salt. Grease a pudding-mould; press the potato
in firmly, and turn out upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Berry Dumplings.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of prepared flour; 2½ tablespoonfuls of lard
and butter mixed; 2 cups of milk, or enough to make a
soft dough.</p>

<p>Roll out a quarter of an inch thick; cut into oblong
pieces, rounded at the corners. Put blackberries or
huckleberries in the middle, sprinkle with sugar, and bring
the edges together, pinching them to keep them from
parting. Put into the oven with the joined edges downward,
and bake forty minutes. Glaze with butter just
before taking them up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Squirrel Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 large fine gray squirrels, skinned, cleaned and cut up,
1 lb. lean corned ham, cut into dice; 1 onion; 2 blades
of mace; a little cayenne; juice of a lemon; browned
flour; 3 quarts of cold water; dripping; 2 tablespoonfuls
of butter.</p>

<p>Fry squirrel and onion in the dripping to a light brown.
Drain off the fat and put them into the soup-pot with the
water, ham, and mace. Cover closely, and stew until
the meat is in rags, and the water reduced one-third.
Strain, cool, and skim; season and put over the fire.
When it boils, skim well, and stir in the butter, cut up in
browned flour. When it has thickened, add the lemon-juice
and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Chicken.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash and cut up a pair of full-grown chickens.
Wash, but do not soak. Put into a pot with half a pound
of fat salt pork, cut very thin, and enough cold water to
cover them. Heat very slowly, and cook until tender.
When done add a chopped onion, with chopped parsley
and pepper. Cover again, and five minutes later, stir in
a great tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour. Heat in
another saucepan a cup of milk; add two beaten eggs;
boil one minute. Arrange the chickens upon a dish;
strain the gravy; stir in the milk and eggs, and without
putting again over the fire, pour over the fowls.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Rice.</span></h3>

<p>Wash well in several waters. Strain a half cupful of
your chicken gravy with an equal quantity of soup; add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
a little boiling water, and put on with the rice in a farina-kettle.
When it is quite soft, and has absorbed all the
broth, salt it, and stir in a little boiling milk in which has
been melted a teaspoonful of butter, and a little minced
parsley. Turn into a hot dish, when it has soaked up the
milk, and pass grated cheese with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and slice fine ripe tomatoes. Put into a bake-dish
with alternate layers of buttered bread-crumbs. Season
each stratum of tomato with pepper, salt and sugar.
Bake covered, until very hot—then, brown. The uppermost
layer should be of crumbs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>See Wednesday, First Week in August.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit.</span></h3>

<p>Dispose to the best advantage in baskets or dishes, with
a garnishing of green leaves.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ham and Veal Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 lbs. of lean ham—that near the hock will do—cut into
strips; 2 lbs. of lean veal; 2 carrots; 2 onions; 1 blade
of mace; ¼ of a cabbage heart, minced and parboiled;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
2 lemons; pepper; 4 quarts of water; 1 tablespoonful
of flour wet up in cold water.</p>

<p>Put on meat, chopped vegetables, and water, and cook
for four hours. Strain, cool, and take off the fat. The
vegetables should be pulped through the colander. Return
to the fire, boil and skim for five minutes; having
seasoned with pepper, stir in the flour; boil three minutes,
and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>2½ lbs. of rumpsteak; 1 quart of prepared flour; ¼ lb.
powdered suet, chopped with the flour; pepper; salt; a
very little minced parsley; 1 small pickled onion, chopped;
nearly a cupful of broth, taken from the soup, cooled and
skimmed.</p>

<p>Make a paste of the suet and salted flour mixed with a
little ice-water. Roll it out and line a round bowl with it.
Cut the meat into dice; pepper and salt each piece, and
roll in flour. Put them inside of the paste; strew over
them the parsley and pickle, and pour in the <i>cold</i> gravy.
Cover the top with a paste-crust, overlapping the greased
edges of the bowl; press this down firmly all around; envelop
all in a stout cloth, tied tightly under the bottom
of the bowl; plunge into boiling water and cook, at a
steady boil, two hours and a quarter. Untie the cloth,
invert the bowl with care over a hot dish; turn out the
pudding, and serve at once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Egg-plant.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil for ten minutes. Slit down the side, and take
out the seeds. Prop open the cut with a bit of clean
wood, and lay in salt and water for one hour. Stuff with
a force-meat of crumbs, fat salt pork, salt, pepper, nutmeg,
parsley, and a bit of onion, all chopped. Moisten
with a good gravy. Wind soft string about the egg-plant,
to keep the cut closed, and bake, putting a cupful of weak
broth in the dripping pan. Baste frequently; at first,
with butter and water, then with the gravy. Baste twice
with butter at the last. Lay the egg-plant in a deep dish;
add to the gravy a tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
and, when this boils, two or three spoonfuls of milk or
cream. Just boil, and pour upon the egg-plant.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Whip boiled potatoes light with a fork; beat in milk,
butter, and salt, and heap like rock-work upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Summer Salad.</span></h3>

<p>2 heads of lettuce; a handful of water-cresses; 5 very
tender radishes, scraped and cut up; 1 cucumber, pared,
laid in ice-water for an hour, then sliced; 3 hard-boiled
eggs; 2 teaspoonfuls of white sugar, and 1, each, of salt,
pepper, and made mustard; 2 tablespoonfuls of salad oil,
and 6 of vinegar.</p>

<p>Rub sugar, salt, pepper, and mustard, to a paste with
the oil. Pound the yolks fine, and work in. Then whip
in, very gradually, the vinegar. Arrange the vegetables,
all cut up neatly, in a salad-bowl, and <i>strain</i> the dressing
over it. Garnish with the whites, sliced, laid around in a
chain, with a nasturtium flower in every two or three
links.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Trifle.</span></h3>

<p>12 fine peaches, pared and sliced very thin; 1 package
Coxe’s gelatine; 2 cups white sugar; 1 pint of boiling
and 1 cup of cold, water; 1 cup of rich, sweet cream,
with a pinch of soda dissolved in it, then whipped light in
a syllabub-churn.</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine two hours in the cup of cold water.
Put it, with peaches and sugar, into a bowl; cover, and
let stand an hour. Then pour on the boiling water; stir
and mash the peaches, and strain through muslin. When
cold and slightly congealed, beat in quickly, a spoonful
at a time, the whipped cream. It should be thick and
white, or faintly colored. Form in a wet mould set an
ice. Eat with cake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>

Cauliflower Soup, without Meat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fillets of Halibut, with Potatoes.<br />

<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower Soup, without Meat.</span></h3>

<p>1 fine cauliflower; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter rolled in 1
of flour; 1 onion; bunch of parsley; 2 blades of mace;
2 quarts of water; 2 cups of milk; pepper and salt; a
pinch of soda in the milk.</p>

<p>Cut the cauliflower into bunches, reserving about a
cupful of small clusters to put whole into the soup. Chop
the rest, also the onion and herbs, and put on in the
water, with the mace. Cook an hour, and rub through a
colander. Return the <i>purée</i>, thus obtained, to the pot,
and season with pepper and salt. As it boils, stir in the
whole clusters, previously boiled tender in hot, salted
water, and left to cool. When the soup is again hot, put
in the floured butter; stir until this has thickened; pour
into the tureen, and add the boiling milk. Pass sliced
lemon and cream crackers with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fillets of Halibut, with Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of halibut, cut into strips three inches long, one
wide, and three-quarters of an inch thick; 3 tablespoonfuls
of butter; pepper; salt; 1 teaspoonful of anchovy
paste; a pinch of cayenne; a little boiling water; juice
of a lemon.</p>

<p>Lay the slices of fish in salt and water for half an hour.
Wipe them dry. Have ready the butter in a saucepan,
with pepper and salt. When it is hot, put in the pieces
of fish, and cook gently, without browning, until tender.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, cut some potatoes round with your “gouge,”
or, if you have none, into neat squares; parboil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
drain them, and simmer ten minutes in enough hot milk
to cover them; then stir in a lump of butter; season
with pepper and salt. Cook five minutes; drain the
liquid into another saucepan, and keep the potatoes hot.
Lay the fish in order upon a hot dish, the potatoes around
it, and set over hot water, while you thicken the milk in
which the potatoes were boiled (never omitting the pinch
of soda), with a little flour. Boil up, add the butter used
for cooking the fish, and the anchovy sauce. Squeeze a
small lemon over the fish, and pour on the hot sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef’s Tongue with Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil a corned tongue. Take it from the water,
trim off the root and pare away the skin. Put into a
broad saucepan with a cup of yesterday’s soup, half a
minced onion, a teaspoonful of sugar, a little parsley and
pepper. Cover, and cook slowly one hour, or until tender.
Slice round, and lay upon a hot dish. Heap each
slice with a great spoonful of green peas boiled in hot
salted water, drained well, and seasoned with butter, salt,
and pepper. Strain the gravy, add a little of the water
in which the tongue was boiled, a small spoonful of made
mustard—French mustard if you have it—the juice of
half a lemon, and thicken with browned flour. Boil up
and serve in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Corn Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>See Friday of First Week in August.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Cucumbers.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, lay in ice-water one hour; slice, and pile upon
pounded ice in a glass dish, passing the condiments with
them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Melons, Peaches, and Pears.</span></h3>

<p>Serve the melons upon flat dishes; the peaches and
pears in fruit-salvers or in fancy baskets, with green leaves
and flowers disposed tastefully among them. All would
be the more refreshing for having lain in the ice-box or
refrigerator awhile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Stock Soup.</span></h3>

<p>5 lbs. of beef, and as many of bones; 2 carrots; 2
onions, sliced and fried in dripping; 2 turnips; bunch of
herbs; 7 quarts of water; 2 teaspoonfuls essence of celery,
or 3 stalks of the green plant, with the tops cut off;
pepper and salt; dice of fried bread; 1 large spoonful of
tomato catsup.</p>

<p>Cut up the meat, and chop the vegetables. Put with
the herbs and cracked bones into a pot, and pour on two
quarts of water. Heat slowly, and after it has boiled one
hour, skim well, and add the other five quarts—also cold.
Cook steadily four or five hours longer, then strain, rubbing
the vegetables to pieces. There should be at least
five quarts of liquid. If, in the boiling, it has lost too
much, you should have replenished the pot with boiling
water. Take out two quarts for to-day’s soup. Return
meat and bones to the fire, and pour the rest of the soup
over them with another quart of cold water. Cover very
closely and simmer at the back of the range two hours
longer. Then set away in an earthenware vessel, having
seasoned it, and when cold, put on ice. You will now
have made soup-stock for three days.</p>

<p>Cool the portion kept out for to-day; take off all the
fat, season and re-heat it. Boil gently and skim well.
Stir in the catsup, and pour upon the fried bread already
put into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Wash a ham thoroughly, scrubbing off all the rusty
parts with the dust. Put on in plenty of cold water, and
boil twenty minutes to the pound. Let it get almost cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
in the water. If possible, do this on Friday, and do not
skin until perfectly cold on Saturday. The fat will then
be white and prettily pitted, and the skin leave it easily.
Twist frilled paper about the shank, and lay in a bed of
curled fresh parsley. Carve in thin slices.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Onion Tomato Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>2 quarts of ripe tomatoes; 1 onion, chopped; 1 tablespoonful
of chopped parsley; 2 teaspoonfuls sugar; pepper
and salt to taste; 1 tablespoonful of butter rolled in
flour.</p>

<p>Pare the tomatoes, and slice thin. Stew with the onion
half an hour; then pulp through a colander; return to
the saucepan with the seasoning, and when again hot, stir
in the parsley and floured butter. Boil gently three minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Squash au Gratin.</span></h3>

<p>Boil and mash, as usual, pressing out the water. Beat
up with a good bit of butter, season with pepper and salt;
finally whip in two or three tablespoonfuls of milk and
a raw egg. Pour into a buttered pudding dish; strew
thickly with fine crumbs and bake in a quick oven to a
light brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stripped Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and cut potatoes lengthwise into strips. Lay in
ice-water half an hour. Dry between two clean towels,
and fry to a pale brown in hot, salted lard. Shake in a
heated colander to clear them of the fat, and turn into a
dish lined with a napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Whole Peach Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Pare ripe peaches without removing the stones. Have
your pie-dishes ready lined with a good paste, fill with the
peaches; strew these with sugar, and cover with crust.
Bake in a steady oven. Sift sugar over it, and eat fresh,
with cream poured upon each slice.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Vermicelli Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the top of your soup-stock; dip out
rather more than half. Add a little seasoning to that which
remains, and return to the ice. Should the weather be very
warm it will be wise to heat all together, and then divide,
returning the smaller portion to the ice. Warm the stock
designed for to-day with the remains of yesterday’s tomato
sauce; and when it begins to boil, strain through
thin, coarse muslin. Put back over the fire, and take off
all the scum that rises in ten minutes’ boil. Then put in
a scant cupful of vermicelli, which has been broken up
small, boiled five minutes in very hot water, and drained.
Simmer five minutes, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Beef and Browned Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Have all gristly parts of the beef cut away, and such
bones removed as will injure the shape, or embarrass the
carver. Put the beef into a dripping-pan, throw a cupful
of boiling water over it, and roast ten minutes per pound,
basting <i>very</i> often and copiously. Just before taking it
up, dredge with flour and baste once with butter. After
dishing the meat, pour the top from the gravy; add a little
boiling water; put it into a saucepan, and thicken with
browned flour. Pepper, and serve after a brief boil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Browned Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, and strip off the skins of large, fair potatoes. Half
an hour before you take up the meat pour off the fat from
the gravy; lay your potatoes in the dripping-pan, and
cook brown, basting frequently. Lay about the meat
when dished.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Egg-plant.</span></h3>

<p>Slice half an inch thick, and lay in salt water one hour,
with a heavy plate on top to keep under the water. Pare
each slice. Make a batter of two eggs, a cup of milk, a
little salt, and flour for thin batter. Wipe the egg-plant
perfectly dry; dip each slice in the batter, and fry in hot
dripping. Drain well, and serve on a heated flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Green Corn.</span></h3>

<p>Strip off all but the thin husk next the corn. Turn this
down, and pick off the silk from the grains. Replace the
husk, tie a thread about it to keep it smooth, and cook
the corn from thirty to forty minutes, according to size
and age. Pull off the husk; break the stalk close to the
ear, and serve, wrapped in a napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and slice; put into a salad dish, and dress as follows:
Rub one teaspoonful of sugar, and half as much
each of pepper, salt, and French or other made mustard,
smooth with two tablespoonfuls of salad-oil. Beat in, a
little at a time, five tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and half a
teaspoonful extract of celery. Pour over the tomatoes,
and set on ice until wanted.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Narcissus Blanc-Mange.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 1 package Cooper’s gelatine, soaked
in 2 cups of cold water; yolks of 4 eggs, beaten light;
2 cups white sugar; 1 large cup of sweet cream, whipped
with a little powdered sugar, and flavored with vanilla;
rose-water for the blanc-mange.</p>

<p>Heat the milk to scalding. Stir in the sugar and gelatine,
and when these are dissolved, beat in the yolks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
cook two minutes. Turn out into a shallow dish to cool.
When it begins to form, put, a few spoonfuls at a time,
into a bowl, and whip vigorously, flavoring with rose-water.
When it is a yellow sponge, put into a wet mould,
with a cylinder in the centre. Do this on Saturday. On
Sunday turn into a dish, and fill the hole in the middle
with whipped cream, just churned. Lay more whipped
cream about the base. Like all other preparations of
gelatine, this should be kept upon ice until you are ready
to use it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Iced Coffee and Sliced Cake.</span></h3>

<p>Make the coffee at breakfast-time. It should be very
strong. While hot add one-fourth as much boiling milk.
When cool put on ice, and serve with more ice in the
tumblers. Send around a basket of cake with it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ham and Egg Soup.</span></h3>

<p>A ham-bone broken to bits; 1 quart of cold water; 3
pints of good stock; as many poached eggs as you have
people at table; a little pepper; ½ cup of rice.</p>

<p>Boil your ham-bone in a quart of water until the liquid
is reduced one-half. Strain off the stock from the meat
and bones in the jar or bowl; add the ham broth and
half a cup of well-soaked rice. Simmer until this is soft,
skimming often, and pour into the tureen. Lay the poached
eggs, neatly trimmed, round upon the top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Braised Larded Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Lard yesterday’s cold roast with strips of fat salt pork;
lay in a broad saucepan; half cover with gravy, and strew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
minced onion over it. Cover closely and stew slowly at
back of the range one hour. Dish the meat; boil down
the gravy fast for a few minutes, and pour over it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chopped Potatoes and Corn.</span></h3>

<p>Split each row of grain upon cobs of cold boiled corn,
and cut them off clean. Add twice as much chopped
cold boiled potatoes. Have a little good dripping hot in
a frying-pan. Put in potatoes and corn and stir until very
hot, but do not let them brown. Serve in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cucumber and Onion Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Pare the cucumbers and lay in ice-water one hour. Do
the same with the onions in another bowl. Then slice
them in the proportion of one onion to three large cucumbers,
and arrange in a salad-bowl, and season with vinegar,
pepper, and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, quarter and boil the squash in hot salted water.
Drain, mash very smooth, and put back over the fire with a
few spoonfuls of milk, a little chopped parsley, and a good
lump of butter, rolled in flour. Stew five minutes, after
the boil begins, stirring well from the bottom most of the
time. Pour into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peaches and Cream.</span></h3>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Hash Soup.</span></h3>

<p>The remains of your roast beef—bones cracked, and
meat, skin, etc., chopped; 6 potatoes, boiled and mashed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
bunch of herbs, chopped; 1 sliced onion; salt and pepper;
3 quarts of water; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, rolled
in flour; 1 tablespoonful of walnut catsup.</p>

<p>Put on meat, bones, herbs, onion, and water, and simmer
two hours, until the nourishment is all drawn from
them. Strain, cool, take off the fat; rub in the potatoes
through a colander, and season. When it is again hot,
stir in the floured butter, and after boiling one minute,
the catsup. Pour into the tureen. If you have any soup
left from yesterday, you may add it to this, when the potatoes
go in.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kidneys Sautés with Wine.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the kidneys into thin slices, and cook ten minutes
in a little dripping in a frying-pan. Take out and lay
upon a hot-water dish, covering closely. Add to the
dripping in the pan a little gravy—beef will do, or a little
of your soup; season with a chopped onion, parsley, salt
and pepper, and thicken with browned flour. Boil up;
add a glass of good wine and the juice of half a lemon.
Pour upon the kidneys, and set in boiling water five minutes.
If kidneys are cooked too long they toughen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Omelette aux Fines Herbes.</span></h3>

<p>7 eggs; ½ cup of milk in which has been dissolved
a quarter teaspoonful of corn-starch; 1 tablespoonful
minced herbs; pepper and salt; butter and onion.</p>

<p>Beat the yolks very smooth, and whip in the milk;
then stir in the frothed whites. Put a tablespoonful of
butter in a round, rather shallow bake-pan; add the
chopped herbs and a little finely minced onion. Set upon
the upper grating of the oven until it begins to simmer.
Pour in the omelette and bake quickly until high, and
delicately browned. Run a sharp knife quickly around
the edge and invert the dish upon a hot platter. Or, if
your bake-dish is presentable, serve in it. Eat at once,
as it soon falls.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">String-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off both ends, and pare the strings from both sides.
Cut into short pieces, and cook thirty minutes, or until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
tender, in boiling salt water. Drain, season with pepper,
salt and butter, and serve in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower au Gratin.</span></h3>

<p>Cook a cauliflower—tied up in a net—in boiling salt
water, fifteen minutes. Drain, clip into small clusters,
and lay in a stone-china or block-tin dish. Pour a cup
of drawn butter over it; strew thickly with fine crumbs,
and brown upon the upper grating of a brisk oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Syllabub and May’s Cake.</span></h3>

<p>Whip a pint of cream to a stiff froth in your syllabub-churn,
sweetening as you go on, with half a cup of powdered
sugar. When it is a snowy mass upon the sieve
upon which you have laid it as it rises, beat in a glass of
wine. Set upon ice until wanted, then fill into glasses.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ayrshire Broth.</span></h3>

<p>Knuckle of veal—well cracked—about 4 lbs.; 3 onions;
½ lb. of lean ham; 2 turnips; bunch of parsley; 1 scant
cup of barley soaked two hours in a little milk.</p>

<p>Put on meat, bones, and barley, and stew slowly in a
gallon of water three hours. Then add the vegetables,
cut into neat dice, parboiled, and left to cool. Cook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
gently one hour and a half. Strain without pressing.
Pick out the meat and bones, and return to the soup-pot
with three pints of broth. Add a quart of cold water;
cook, covered, one hour more, and season well. Turn
into a jar or bowl, and when cold, set on ice for to-morrow’s
soup. Cool that meant for to-day; skim, season,
and put over the fire with the barley and vegetables.
When it begins to boil, pour into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chickens à la Française.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, and then blanch a sweetbread by dropping it into
cold water. Then chop, mix with the pounded boiled
livers of the chickens, and one-sixth as much bread-crumbs
as you have meat. Season. Have ready, cleaned and
washed, a pair of nice chickens. Fill with this force-meat.
Cover the breasts and sides with thin slices of fat salt
pork; put into a dripping-pan; pour about them a large
cupful of boiling water, and roast—basting often—one
hour. Take off the pork; lay it in the gravy, and dredge
the fowls with flour. As this browns, baste well, with
butter once, three times with gravy. Take up and keep
hot while you strain; cool, skim and thicken the gravy.
Have ready cooked a cup of rice measured when raw—which
has been boiled in the water used for cooking the
sweetbread and livers, then seasoned. Make a broad,
flat-topped mound of it upon a dish; lay the chickens on
it, and pour a little of the gravy over them. Serve the
rest in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Succotash.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the corn from eight or ten cobs; mix this with one
third the quantity of Lima beans, and cook one hour in
just enough water to cover them. Drain off most of the
water; add a cupful of milk, with a pinch of soda stirred
in. When this boils, stir in a great spoonful of butter
rolled in flour; season with pepper and salt, and simmer
ten minutes longer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Select those of uniform size; parboil them, with the
skins on. Peel and lay in a baking-pan. Bake until soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
to the grasp, glazing with butter just before you take
them up.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and slice juicy tart apples, and stew with just enough
water to keep them from burning, until broken to pieces.
Stir deeply and well, often. Beat a good lump of butter
into them while hot, sweeten abundantly, and season with
nutmeg. Mash and beat all the lumps to smoothness, or
take them out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Blackberry Shortcake—Hot.</span></h3>

<p>2 quarts of sifted flour; 3 tablespoonfuls of butter, and
2 of lard; 2½ cups of buttermilk, or sour, thick milk;
yolks of 2 eggs, beaten light; 1 teaspoonful of soda, dissolved
in hot water, and the same quantity of salt.</p>

<p>Rub the shortening into the salted flour. Add beaten
yolks and soda to the milk, and make out the paste
quickly. Roll into two sheets—that intended for the
upper crust half an inch thick, the lower, rather thinner.
Lay the batter in a well greased baking-pan; cover <i>thickly</i>
with the berries; sugar them; put on the top crust, and
bake about twenty-five minutes to a nice brown. Cut
into squares and eat—splitting these open—with sugar and
butter.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and slice twelve large tomatoes, and stew twenty
minutes. Rub through a colander to a pulp; season this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
with pepper, salt, and sugar. Take the fat from the top
of your cold soup-stock, and put the latter over the fire.
Simmer half an hour; strain out meat and bones. Boil
and skim three minutes, and add the tomato sauce.
Cook gently ten minutes; stir in a tablespoonful (even)
of corn-starch wet with cold water. Boil up and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Leg of Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Cook in plenty of hot salted water, allowing twelve
minutes to the pound. Take out when done, wipe carefully;
dish, and rub all over with butter. Serve with
caper sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Caper Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Take a cupful of the liquor in which the meat has
been boiled. Put on in a saucepan; boil and skim for a
moment; stir in two tablespoonfuls of butter rubbed into
a heaping teaspoonful of flour. Stir over the fire five
minutes, add the juice of a lemon, pepper, and two dozen
pickled capers—or, if you have not these, pickled nasturtium
seed. Send to table in a boat. Save the rest of the
pot-liquor for soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare as usual, whipping light with a fork, and heaping
upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Egg-plant.</span></h3>

<p>Soak and stuff as directed on Thursday, Fourth Week
in August, but instead of baking it, put on in a cupful of
your soup-stock, and stew, closely covered, one hour, or
until very tender. Take up and keep hot in a deep dish.
Stir a lump of butter rolled in flour into the gravy; boil
up and pour over the egg-plant.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Shell, and cook about forty minutes in boiling, salted
water. Drain, pepper, salt and stir in a good lump of
butter when dished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of flour; 1 cup of milk; ⅓ cup of yeast; 2
tablespoonfuls of sugar; 4 eggs; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter;
a little salt; ripe, freestone peaches, pared and
stoned.</p>

<p>Sift the flour into a bowl; work in milk and yeast, and
let it rise five or six hours. Then, beat eggs and sugar
light with butter, salt, and stir into the risen dough. Knead
faithfully with your hands. Pull off bits nearly as large as
an egg. Flatten and put in the centre of each a peach
(pared), from which the stone has been slipped out through
a slit in one side. Close the dough over it; make into a
round ball, and lay upon a floured pan for the second rising.
The balls must not touch each other. In an hour they
should be light. Fry as you would doughnuts, but more
slowly. Drain in a colander, and eat hot with brandy-sauce.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fish Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 quarts of broth; 2 lbs. of halibut, rock, or other
white fish; 2 onions; salt and cayenne; juice of half a
lemon; dripping for frying.</p>

<p>Cut the fish into neat strips; take out the bones.
Remove the fat from the cold pot-liquor set by yesterday,
put in the fish-bones, and put on to stew down. Fry the
sliced onions; drain from the fat; lay in the bottom of
your soup-pot; put the fish upon them; put in a little
broth, and simmer gently one hour. Take out the fish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
dredge each piece with flour, and return to the kettle.
Cover with two quarts of the strained stock, and cook,
slowly, half an hour. Add cayenne and lemon, and pour
out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Batter Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups of milk; 1 large cupful of flour; 2 eggs; neat
squares of cold mutton, freed from skin and fat; pepper
and salt; some melted butter, heated with tomato catsup.</p>

<p>Make a batter of the milk, eggs and flour. Lay the
meat in the melted butter, pepper and salt; butter a pudding-dish;
pour in a little of the batter; then add the
meat soaked well in the butter; pour in the rest of the
batter, and bake one hour in a steady oven. Serve at
once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes and Corn.</span></h3>

Cut the corn from four cobs, mix up well together, and
stew half an hour. Season with pepper, salt and butter,
stew again ten minutes, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and cut the potatoes into small squares or rounds.
Cook twenty minutes in boiling water, a little salt. Turn
this off; add a cupful of milk; and when this bubbles up

up with cold milk, also, a little chopped parsley. Simmer
five minutes and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Cake with Cream.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups of powdered sugar; 3 cups of prepared flour;
½ cup of corn-starch, wet with a little milk; ½ cup of butter
creamed with the sugar; ½ cup of sweet milk; the
whites of six eggs, whipped stiff.</p>

<p>Add the milk to the creamed butter and sugar; the
corn-starch, then the flour and whites alternately. Bake
in jelly-cake tins.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Filling.</span></h3>

<p>3 tart, well-flavored apples, grated; yolks of 2 beaten
eggs; 1 cup of sugar; 1 lemon, juice, and half the grated
rind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">White Stock Soup.</span></h3>

<p>6 lbs. knuckle of veal; ½ lb. lean bacon; 2 tablespoonfuls
of butter rubbed in 1 of flour; 2 onions; 2
carrots; 2 turnips; 3 cloves stuck in an onion; 1 blade
of mace; bunch of herbs; 6 quarts of water; pepper
and salt; 1 cup of boiling milk.</p>

<p>Cut up the meat and crack the bones. Slice carrots,
turnips, and one onion, leaving that with the cloves whole.
Put on with mace, and all the herbs except the parsley,
in two quarts of cold water. Bring to a slow boil;
take off the scum, as it rises, and at the end of an hour’s
stewing, add the rest of the cold water—one gallon.
Cover and cook steadily, always gently, four hours.
Strain off the liquor, of which there should be about five
quarts; rub the vegetables through the colander, and
pick out bones and meat. Season these highly, and put,
as is your Saturday custom, into a wide-mouthed jar, or a
large bowl. Add to them three quarts of stock, well
salted, and, when cold, keep on ice. Cool to-day’s stock;
remove the fat; season, put in chopped parsley, and put
over the fire. Heat in a saucepan a cup of milk, stir in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
the floured butter; cook three minutes. When the soup
has simmered ten minutes after the last boil, and been
carefully skimmed, pour into the tureen, and stir in the
hot, thickened milk.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mock Quails.</span></h3>

<p>Cut slices about four inches square, and half an inch
thick, from a leg of veal; flatten with the side of a
hatchet, and dip in beaten egg. Make a force-meat of a
cold boiled sweetbread, chopped fine, a little minced fat
pork or ham, a few oysters, also minced, and a seasoning
of pepper, cloves, nutmeg, and a pinch of grated lemon-peel.
Wet with oyster-liquor, and the juice of half a
lemon. Spread the slices with this, and roll each up
tightly. Bind with soft thread, and lay in a broad saucepan.
Half cover with broth borrowed from your soup,
cooled and skimmed. Cover and stew slowly nearly one
hour. Make the remnants of the force-meat—adding a
few bread crumbs—into small balls. Roll in flour and set
in the oven until browned. Five minutes before you take
up the meat, roll these in beaten yolk of egg, once and
again, until thickly coated. Let them stand to cool while
you take up the “quails.” Lay them upon a hot dish;
clip and gently withdraw the threads. Strain the gravy;
add a little boiling water; thicken with browned flour;
stir in a spoonful of butter, and when it boils, drop in
the “quail eggs.” Simmer just one minute, and pour
over the meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kidney-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Shell; cook in boiling salted water thirty minutes, or
until tender; drain, dish, and season with pepper, butter
and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups of grated corn; 2 eggs; 1 cup of milk; flour
for thin batter; a pinch of soda; salt; 1 tablespoonful
melted butter.</p>

<p>Mix and fry as you would griddle-cakes.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tapioca Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from your soup-stock. Dip out two quarts,
add one large cup of boiling water, and strain into the
soup-kettle. Heat to a slow boil; skim carefully; add
half a cup of grained tapioca, soaked two hours in a little
cold water; cook until this is clear; put in what additional
seasoning your taste demands, with a glass of wine, and
a teaspoonful of celery essence, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Ducks.</span></h3>

<p>Put sage and onion in the stuffing for one; make that
intended for the other, of bread-crumbs, seasoned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
pepper and salt, and wet up slightly with milk. Lay the
ducks in the dripping-pan; pour boiling water over them,
and roast, basting often, until tender and brown. Dish;
take the fat from the gravy; season, thicken with browned
flour and boil up. Serve in a gravy-boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Choose enough large, smooth tomatoes to fill a shallow
pudding-dish. Cut a slice from the top of each, scoop
out the inside. Chop the pulp with a little cold meat,
taken from your soup, a sprinkling of minced onion, and
the grated corn from two cobs. Season with pepper, salt
and butter; fill the tomatoes, put on the top slices; fill
the interstices with the force-meat, pour on a little gravy,
cover and bake forty minutes—then brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower with Sauce Tartare.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a large cauliflower—tied in netting—in hot salted
water, from twenty-five to thirty minutes. Drain; serve
in a deep dish with the flower upwards, and pour over it
a cup of drawn butter, in which has been stirred the juice
of a lemon, and a half teaspoonful of French mustard,
mixed up well with the sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Please see Wednesday of First Week in September.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Melons, Peaches, and Pears.</span></h3>

<p>Serve the melons upon a flat dish; the other fruit in
baskets, or upon fruit-stands, garnished with leaves.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Vegetable Consommé.</span></h3>

<p>Cut into thin, short strips, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, and 1
onion; peel and slice 6 fine tomatoes; corn cut from
2 cobs; ½ cup boiled rice; 3 pints of soup-stock; 1 pint
of boiling water; seasoning at discretion.</p>

<p>Boil the vegetables tender in a little hot salted water.
Drain, butter, and keep them hot. The tomatoes and corn
should be stewed in another vessel, twenty-five minutes,
and seasoned. Add to your soup-stock a pint of boiling
water, and simmer half an hour, then strain. Return to
the fire with the cooked vegetables and the boiled rice.
Stew gently ten minutes and turn out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Lamb à la Jardinière.</span></h3>

<p>Lay a breast of lamb, or two scrags, in a broad pot,
meat downward. Scatter over this a sliced turnip, a sliced
onion, and two sliced tomatoes, with a little pepper and
salt. Add less than a cupful of broth from your soup;
cover, and cook slowly one hour. Turn the meat then,
and cook one hour longer, very slowly. When tender,
but not ragged, dish, and keep hot. Strain the gravy;
thicken with browned flour; season; boil up, and pour
over the meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">French Beans Sautés.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off the fibres from both sides of the (string) beans,
and clip into short pieces. Boil tender in hot salted
water; drain dry, and put into a saucepan in which you have
melted a great spoonful of butter, seasoned with pepper,
a little French mustard, and a tablespoonful of vinegar.
Toss and stir until the beans are very hot, and glazed with
the butter. Serve in a deep dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes au Gratin.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Gravy Soup.</span></h3>

<p>4 lbs. of lean, coarse beef, cut into strips; 2 lbs. mutton
or beef bones, broken small; 2 onions, sliced and
fried; bunch of sweet herbs; 3 carrots; 2 turnips; 5
quarts of cold water; pepper and salt; dripping.</p>

<p>Fry the meat and onions in the dripping to a light
brown. Put on in two quarts of water, and having cooked
one hour, add the other vegetables chopped, and the
remaining three quarts of water, cold. Boil slowly four
hours, skimming often. Strain, pulping the vegetables.
Put meat and bones into the stock-pot, season well; divide
the broth into two portions; salt one, and pour into the
stock-pot. When cold, set on ice for to-morrow. Cool
and skim the rest; heat and skim until quite clear. Put
dice of fried bread into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Paté de Foie de Veau.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of calf’s liver—parboiled and cold; ½ lb. of cold
cooked ham; 3 eggs; 1 tablespoonful of butter, and same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
of fine crumbs; 1 scant cup of milk; a little minced onion
and parsley; nutmeg, cayenne, and a pinch of grated
lemon-peel; some good pie-paste.</p>

<p>Mince the ham, and pound the boiled liver. Make into
a sort of paste with the butter, beaten eggs, bread-crumbs,
milk, and seasoning. It should be just soft enough to
pour. Butter a bake-dish profusely; line with a good
paste, rolled out thicker than for most pies. Fill this with
the liver mixture; cover with crust, which must not overlap
the edge of the dish, but be pinched down firmly upon
the lower crust; set in a pan, containing a cupful of boiling
water, just enough to keep the bottom crust from
burning, and bake one hour and a quarter in a moderate
oven. Pass a knife around the edges of the crust to detach
the paté; invert upon a deep dish. Pass with it
drawn butter in which have been beaten two raw eggs, and
these thickened by two minutes’ boiling.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare a “turban” squash, and cut off a slice from the
top. Extract the seeds, and lay one hour in salt water.
Then fill with a good stuffing of crumbs, chopped fat salt
pork, parsley, etc., wet with gravy. Put on the top slice;
set the squash in a pudding-dish. Put a few spoonfuls
of melted butter and twice as much hot water in the bottom;
cover the dish <i>very</i> closely, and set in the oven two
hours, or until tender. Lay within a deep dish, and pour
the gravy over it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Succotash.</span></h3>

<p>See Wednesday, First Week in September.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, wipe, and lay in a moderate oven. Bake until
soft to the grasp. Send to table in their skins, wrapped
in a napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Blackberry Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 pint of milk; 2 eggs; 1 quart flour, or enough for
thick batter; 1 gill bakers’ yeast; 1 saltspoonful of salt;
1 teaspoonful of soda dissolved in boiling water; nearly a
quart of berries, dredged with flour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span></p>

<p>Make the batter and let it rise in a warm place four
hours. When very light, stir in the dredged fruit lightly
and quickly; pour into a buttered dish and bake one hour,
covering with white paper should it “crust” over too fast.
Turn out, and eat with sweet sauce.</p>

mushrooms; pepper and salt; 1 cup of milk; floured
butter; 4 quarts water.</p>

taking off the scum as it rises, for three hours, or until the
liquid is reduced one-half. Strain, cool, skim, season and
return to the fire with the chopped mushrooms. Stew
slowly half an hour; stir in a tablespoonful of butter cut
up in one of flour. Boil two minutes and pour into the

<h3><span class="smcap">Egg Soup.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of broth in which the feet and giblets of the
chickens have been boiled; all that you have left of yesterday’s
soup, strained; 4 beaten eggs; parsley, salt and
pepper; dice of stale bread.</p>

<p>Cool and skim the quart of water in which have been
boiled for one hour the cleaned feet and giblets of your
chickens. (Salt the giblets and put them in the refrigerator.)
Set this broth over the fire, and season. When it
boils, take it off, pour it upon the beaten eggs; put all
into a jar and set in boiling water, stirring until it thickens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
Heat in another saucepan the remains of yesterday’s soup—or,
if you have none, a scant quantity of milk, thickened
with floured butter; pour into a tureen, add the egg-broth,
and throw in a good handful of stale bread-dice.
Stir well and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Smothered Chickens with Mushrooms.</span></h3>

<p>Split a pair of young, full-grown chickens down the
back. Lay them, breasts upward, in a dripping-pan;
pour over them a great cupful of boiling water in which
have been melted two tablespoonfuls of butter. Invert
another pan over them, covering closely, and cook in a
steady oven until they are tender and of a mellow russet
hue. An hour is generally sufficient. Baste very often,
twice at the last with butter. Keep the fowls hot upon a
chafing-dish while you add the rest of the can of mushrooms
opened yesterday—each mushroom sliced into
thirds—to the gravy, with browned flour and pepper.
Simmer ten minutes; pour a little upon the chickens, the
rest into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Cauliflower.</span></h3>

<p>Small, and therefore cheap, cauliflowers will do for this
purpose. Boil them in hot salted water twenty minutes.
Drain, cool, and chop. Beat into them a couple of eggs,
a spoonful of melted butter, a half cup of milk, and season.
Pour into a buttered bake-dish; cover with drawn butter,
then with fine crumbs, and bake half an hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Loosen the skins with boiling water; peel, slice, and
stew twenty minutes. Season with sugar, pepper, salt,
a good piece of butter cut up in flour, and stew five minutes
more.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beet-root Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Arrange the cold beets left from yesterday in a salad-dish.
Pour a little salad-oil over them, season with sifted
sugar, salt, a little cayenne, and vinegar at discretion.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Oberlin Soup.</span></h3>

<p>3 onions; 3 turnips; 3 carrots; ½ cabbage; bunch of
herbs; 8 tomatoes, sliced; 3 tablespoonfuls of butter; 1
teaspoonful of corn-starch; pepper, sugar, and salt; 1
cup of boiling milk; 3 quarts of cold water.</p>

<p>Chop the vegetables, and put all except the tomatoes
and cabbage over the fire, with the water. Simmer one
hour. Then add the cabbage, previously parboiled. Ten
minutes later, put in the tomatoes and herbs. Stew rather
fast for half an hour. Rub through a colander; put over
the fire; stir in the butter and corn-starch. Cook five
minutes; season well. Let all stand together at the side
of the range, covered, five minutes, and pour out. Stir
in the boiling milk (with a pinch of soda in it) after the
soup is in the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Pickerel.</span></h3>

<p>If you cannot get pickerel, pike, or salmon-trout, use
rock-fish or bass for this dish. Clean the fish, and, if
large, score the back-bone in several places. Bake slowly,
pouring a cup of boiling water over him at first, afterward
basting often with butter and water. When done, lay
upon a hot-water dish; add to the gravy in the dripping-pan
a cup of milk (with a pinch of soda stirred in), and,
when this heats, stir in two tablespoonfuls of butter, one
teaspoonful of corn-starch, wet in water, and a little
chopped parsley. Boil up once, to thicken, add pepper
and salt to taste, and pour over the fish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Giblet Omelette.</span></h3>

<p>7 eggs; 2 tablespoonfuls of cream; yesterday’s giblets,
chopped very fine and seasoned; 1 good spoonful of
butter.</p>

<p>Beat yolks and whites together; then add the cream.
Heat the butter in the frying-pan; put in the giblets;
shake hard for a moment, and pour in the eggs. Keep
them free from the bottom by shaking, and loosening with
a cake-turner; and, when quite “set,” fold in the middle.
Invert a hot dish over the pan, turn out, and serve at once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Diplomatic Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 4 eggs; 1 cup <i>very</i> fine bread-crumbs;
1 tablespoonful of corn-starch, wet with cold milk; ¼ lb.
of currants, washed, dried, and dredged; 1 cup of sugar.</p>

<p>Soak the bread-crumbs in the milk, setting the vessel
containing them in one of hot water, and heating milk
and crumbs to scalding. Pour upon the beaten eggs and
sugar; add corn-starch; lastly, the dredged currants.
Pour into a buttered mould, and boil an hour and a quarter.

<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Noodle Soup.</span></h3>

<p>1 perfectly clean sheep’s head, cleaned with the skin
left on; 3 lbs. scrag of mutton, broken to pieces; 2
onions; 2 carrots; bunch of herbs; pepper and salt; a
large handful of noodles (see Receipt, Wednesday, First
Week in August); 7 quarts water.</p>

<p>Slice the vegetables, put with the head and scrag into
a soup-kettle, add four quarts of water, and simmer two
hours, or until the sheep’s head is so tender that the
bones will slip out. Skim well, pour in three quarts of
cold water, and after three minutes take out the head
carefully. Lay in a greased bake-dish; as carefully, pull
out the bones through the under side, and put these back
into the soup-kettle. Add the vegetables and herbs;
bring again to a slow boil, and cook three hours longer.
Take out meat and bones; salt highly; put into your
stock-jar, and pour half the broth over them. Season
this also, and put by for another day. Rub the vegetables
through the sieve into the broth left for to-day. Cool,
skim; season, and set over the fire. Boil and skim for two
minutes; add the noodles; simmer twenty minutes, and
pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Sheep’s Head à la Russe.</span></h3>

<p>Let the boiled and boned sheep’s head get cold in the
bake-dish. Then brush over with raw egg, and sift over
it a mixture of fine crumbs, a dust of flour and some
minced parsley (dried and powdered is better), seasoned
with pepper and salt. Set in the oven; baste well with
butter, as it browns. Serve in the dish, and send with it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
a boat of drawn butter, based upon a cupful of the soup
and seasoned with French mustard, the juice of half a
lemon, and some onion pickle minced very fine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Set large, smooth tomatoes in a greased pudding-dish.
Cut a slice from the top of each. Scoop out the seeds,
leaving the walls thickly lined with pulp. Have ready a
cupful of corn grated from the cob, and seasoned with
butter, pepper, and salt. Fill the tomatoes with this;
put on the upper slices, and pour a little gravy over all.
Bake, covered, in a moderate oven, one hour. Serve in
the dish.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rice and Tomato Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Skim the soup in your stock-pot. Strain from the meat
and bones; heat and add a pint of tomatoes, stewed,
strained, and seasoned, and a cup of boiled rice with
the cup of water in which it has been cooked. Season to
taste; simmer fifteen or twenty minutes after it begins to
boil, and turn out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Chickens and Tongue.</span></h3>

<p>Tie the stuffed and trussed chickens in netting, fitted
to their shape, and cook in plenty of boiling water, a little
salt. An hour and a quarter should suffice, if the fowls
are tender. Soak a tongue over night. In the morning,
wash it well and boil eighteen minutes to the pound.
Trim and skin it. Lay in the middle of the dish, with a
chicken on each side, and pour over them drawn butter,
based upon a cupful of the liquor in which the chickens
were boiled, mixed with a little minced parsley. Save
the rest of the liquor.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breaded Egg-plant.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken and Corn Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Skim the liquor in which the chickens were boiled yesterday.
Put over the fire, with the grated corn from
twelve ears. Boil one hour; rub through a colander;
season, heat, and stir in a tablespoonful of butter rolled
in flour, a little finely cut parsley, and a teaspoonful essence
of celery. Simmer five minutes; add a cup of
boiling milk, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Casserole of Rice, with Chickens and Tongue.</span></h3>

<p>Chop the remains of yesterday’s chickens and tongue
fine, with the giblets. Season, and put over the fire, with
a cup of yesterday’s soup, and, when almost on the boil,
add two beaten eggs. Boil a cup of rice in a little of the
chicken-liquor used for your soup, until the rice is soft,
and the liquor absorbed. Beat two eggs into half a cup of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
milk, in which a tablespoonful of butter has been melted.
Stir and beat this into the rice. Let it get cold, and then
line a greased mould with it—one with a cylinder in the
middle will not do. Make the walls of rice-paste an inch
thick; then fill with the mince, which should not be too
soft. Cover with the rice; put the top on the mould;
set in a pot of boiling water, and cook one hour and a
half. Turn out with great care, and pour a little of the
pot-liquor, thickened and seasoned, over it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Onions Stewed Brown.</span></h3>

<p>Top and tail them; skin, and dredge them with flour.
Then fry to a good brown in dripping. Put into a pot,
cover with a little of the liquor in which the tongue was
boiled, and stew slowly two hours, or until tender. Take
up the onions; thicken the sauce with browned flour, add
a tablespoonful of butter, with pepper; boil up, and pour
over the onions.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, wipe, and lay in a moderate oven. Bake until
the largest is soft between your testing fingers. Wipe off,
and serve in their jackets.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Slaw.</span></h3>

<p>Shred the heart of a firm white cabbage. Put into a
salad-bowl, and season with sugar, salt, pepper, oil, and
vinegar. Stir up and toss thoroughly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-starch Hasty Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart fresh milk; 3 tablespoonfuls corn-starch, wet
up in cold milk; 1 tablespoonful of butter; 1 teaspoonful
of salt.</p>

<p>Scald and salt the milk, and stir into it the corn-starch.
Boil steadily, stirring now and then, for fifteen minutes.
Add the butter; let the pudding stand in hot water, uncovered,
after you have ceased to stir, until you are ready
for it; then serve in an open, deep dish. Eat with cream
and sugar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tea and Fancy Biscuits.</span></h3>

<p>If the weather be hot, have iced tea; if cool, and suggestive
of early frosts, or equinoctial storms, introduce the
bright tea-pot and pretty “cozy.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">St. Rémo Broth.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of veal—lean and cut into strips; 2 onions, sliced
and fried; 3 quarts of water; 1 tablespoonful of minced
parsley; ½ cupful of raw rice; 2 tablespoonfuls of grated
cheese; salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Fry the onions in dripping; put in the meat, and fry to
a light brown. Put into the soup-pot with the water, and
boil slowly three hours, or until brought down to two
quarts. The meat should be in rags. Strain; cool, skim,
and season. Put back into the kettle with the rice, which
must have soaked one hour in a little water. This water,
also, must go into the soup. Simmer half an hour. Put
the grated cheese into the tureen, and when the rice has
boiled soft, pour upon the cheese, stir up and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak.</span></h3>

<p>Flatten with the broad side of a hatchet, and broil
quickly upon a greased gridiron. Ten minutes should be
enough if you like it rare. Lay upon a hot dish, turn another
over it, having salted, buttered, and peppered it,
and let it stand five minutes before sending to table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes au Naturel.</span></h3>

<p>Cook, without paring, in boiling salted water, until a
fork will enter easily the largest. Pour off the water; set
the pot, uncovered, upon the range for a moment, to dry
off the moisture; peel rapidly, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kidney-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Shell; cook in boiling water, a little salt, half an hour,
or until tender. Drain, salt, pepper, and butter, and serve
in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and slice. Put into a salad-dish, and pour over
them a dressing made of two tablespoonfuls of oil rubbed
with one teaspoonful of sugar, and half as much, each, of
made mustard, salt, and pepper; then with five tablespoonfuls
of vinegar, whipped in, a little at a time.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit Dessert.</span></h3>

<p>Use your own discretion and consult your own convenience
in devising a tasteful and acceptable dessert of
fruits, such as should now be plenty and cheap. Late
peaches, melons, bananas, pears, and apples, are, some or
all of them, within reach of housekeepers of moderate
means. Arrange in dishes or baskets decorated with
green sprays and flowers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee and Cake.</span></h3>

<p>Consult, also, your discretion and the weather in the
question of hot or iced coffee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ox-Cheek Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 ox-cheeks; 3 onions; 2 carrots; 2 turnips; 12 whole
black peppers; 6 cloves; salt; 5 quarts of water; ½ cup
of German sago.</p>

<p>Break the bones of the cheeks, and wash well with salt
and water. Cover with cold water; bring to a boil, and
throw off the water. Fry the sliced onions, and put into
the pot with the meat, also the sliced carrots, onions, and
spice. Cover with a gallon and a quart of water. Bring
to a slow boil, and keep this up, skimming often, for four
hours. Strain off the liquor; pick out the meat and bones;
salt highly; put into your stock-pot with nearly half the
broth. Set in a cold place for to-morrow. Pulp the vegetables
into that meant for to-day; let it cool; take off the
fat, and put back over the fire. Season to your liking;
add the sago, which should have been soaking for two
hours in a little water, and simmer until it is clear.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Calf’s Hearts.</span></h3>

<p>Wash two fresh calf’s hearts; stuff with a force-meat of
crumbs, chopped salt pork, a little thyme, sage and onion.
Tie up snugly in clean mosquito-netting; put into a broad
saucepan; half cover with broth from your soup from yesterday
or to-day. Cover and stew an hour and three-quarters
gently, turning several times. Take out the
hearts, and keep them hot, while you thicken the gravy
with a tablespoonful of butter cut up in flour. Boil up,
add pepper, salt, a little grated lemon-peel, and the juice
of half a lemon, with a small glass of wine. Pour over
the hearts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>See Thursday, First Week in September.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes au Maître d’Hôtel.</span></h3>

<p>Slice cold boiled potatoes rather thick. Have ready
in a saucepan four or five tablespoonfuls of milk, a good
lump of butter, with salt, pepper and minced parsley.
Heat quickly; put in the potatoes, and stir until almost
boiling. Stir in a little flour, wet with cold milk; cook a
moment to thicken it; add the juice of half a lemon, and
pour out into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes and Onion.</span></h3>

<p>Peel, slice, and stew a dozen tomatoes ten minutes.
Then add a small parboiled onion, cut up small; cook
twenty minutes; stir in sugar, salt and pepper, with a good
spoonful of butter rolled in flour. Simmer five minutes,
and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Pears with Rice.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and halve eight large pears. Put into a saucepan
with eight tablespoonfuls of sugar and a cup of claret—or
if you prefer, clear water. Stew slowly until tender
and clear. Take out the pears and boil down the syrup
to one-half, flavoring, then, with essence of bitter almond.
Have ready two cupfuls of boiled rice, cooked in milk,
and sweetened. Spread upon a flat dish; lay the pears
upon it, and pour on the syrup. Eat very cold.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rissole Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the top of your cold stock. Pick
out some of the best pieces of meat—about a cupful—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
set aside. Add a pint of boiling water to the stock, and
boil slowly, with the bones and the rest of the meat, for
nearly an hour. Chop the meat reserved from the stock;
make into force-meat with fine crumbs, seasoning with
onion, parsley, pepper, salt, nutmeg, and binding with
beaten egg. Flour your hands and make this into round
balls. Roll them in flour; set in a floured pie-dish, not
touching each other, and leave in a quick oven until
crusted over. Let them cool. Strain your soup; add
such seasoning as you desire; heat to a boil; drop in the
force-meat rissoles, and heat, without boiling, three minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lamb Chops.</span></h3>

<p>Trim off fat and skin, leaving a bare bit of bone at the
end of each. Broil quickly over a clear fire; butter, salt,
and pepper each, and stand them on the larger ends, just
touching each other, around your mound of potato.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Mound.</span></h3>

<p>Mash smooth, with butter, milk, salt, and pepper; make
into a smooth mound upon a hot dish, and arrange the
chops around it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Egg-plant.</span></h3>

<p>See Sunday, First Week in September.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ladies’ Cabbage.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a firm cabbage in two waters. When done, quarter
it and let it get perfectly cold. Chop fine; add two
beaten eggs, a tablespoonful of butter, pepper, salt, and
three tablespoonfuls of milk. Stir all well; pour into a
buttered pudding-dish, and bake, covered, until very hot,
then brown. If your dish has been well buttered, turn
the cabbage upon a hot dish, and pour over it a cupful of
drawn butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Damson Tart.</span></h3>

<p>Fill a pie-dish, lined with good paste, with ripe, sound
damsons; sweeten very plentifully; cover with crust and
bake. Brush with beaten egg when done, and return to
the oven one moment, to glaze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Porridge.</span></h3>

<p>12 potatoes, peeled and sliced; 1 large onion, also
pared and sliced; 2 quarts of boiling water; 1 cup of
hot milk; 3 beaten eggs; 3 tablespoonfuls of butter
rolled in flour; salt, pepper, and 1 teaspoonful celery
essence; chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Fry potatoes and onions light brown in a little butter.
Put into a soup-pot with the boiling water, and cook
gently until soft. Rub through a colander to a smooth
<i>purée</i>. Add the water in which they were boiled, and
return to the fire. When the <i>purée</i> begins to bubble, stir
in the buttered flour, pepper, salt, and chopped parsley,
and simmer five minutes. Heat the milk in another vessel;
pour upon the beaten eggs; cook one minute, and
pour into the tureen. Add the <i>purée</i>; stir in the celery-essence,
and it is ready.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Devilled Crabs.</span></h3>

<p>Boil the crabs; cool; break the shells and pick out the
meat. To eight tablespoonfuls of meat, add three of
fine crumbs, the yolks (chopped) of three boiled eggs,
the juice of a lemon, with salt and cayenne to taste.
Work up to a soft mixture with drawn butter; fill scallop
or clam shells, or paté-pans with it, sift cracker-dust over
the top, and brown delicately in a quick oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roasted Sweetbreads.</span></h3>

<p>3 fine sweetbreads; 1 cup of gravy—a cup of your
soup will do; 1 beaten egg; cracker-dust; 1 tablespoonful
mushroom catsup; 1 small glass wine; a very little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
minced onion put into the gravy; 2 tablespoonfuls melted
butter; fried bread.</p>

<p>Boil and blanch the sweetbreads. Wipe perfectly dry,
roll in egg, then in the pounded cracker. Lay in a
baking-pan; pour the melted butter slowly over them,
that it may soak into the crumbs. Set in the oven, cover,
and bake forty-five minutes, basting freely, from the time
they begin to brown, with the gravy. Dish upon crustless
slices of fried bread. Strain the gravy; add catsup and
wine; boil up, and pour over the sweetbreads.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash the potatoes, and beat in a raw egg, butter, milk,
nutmeg, a little grated lemon-peel, with pepper and salt.
Heat in a saucepan, stirring constantly, for three minutes.
The saucepan should be buttered first. When cool
enough to handle with comfort, make into croquettes, roll
in flour, or dip in egg and cracker-crumbs, and fry—not
putting too many into the pan at once—in boiling lard, or
dripping. Drain in a hot colander, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Green Corn.</span></h3>

<p>See Sunday, First Week in September.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Soufflé Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>7 or 8 juicy apples; 4 eggs; 1 cup fine crumbs; 1 cup
of sugar; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter; nutmeg, and a little
grated lemon-peel.</p>

<p>Pare, core, and slice the apples, and cook tender in a
covered farina-kettle without adding water to them. Beat
to a smooth pulp, and stir in butter, sugar, and seasoning.
When cold, whip in the yolks of the eggs; then the
frothed whites, alternately with the crumbs. Beat to a
creamy batter; put into a buttered pudding-dish, and
bake, covered, fifty minutes. Then brown quickly. Eat
hot with custard sauce, or cold, with cream and sugar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rule of Three Soup.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of lean beef; 3 lbs. of marrow bones; 3 lbs.
coarse mutton; 3 onions; 3 carrots; 3 turnips; 3 sprigs
of parsley, and same of thyme and marjoram; 6 quarts
of water; 3 blades of mace; 3 tomatoes; 3 ears of
corn; 3 tablespoonfuls of rice; pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Chop the vegetables; cut up the meat and crack the
bones. Put onions, carrots, turnips, herbs and mace into
the soup-pot; cover with three quarts of water; stew
gently three hours; strain off the broth into a bowl; pour
the remaining three quarts of water, boiling hot, upon the
meat, bones, and vegetables in the pot, and put back
over the fire. Cool that which you have strained; take
off the fat, and put on in another kettle, with the tomatoes,
the corn cut from the cob, and the rice. Season,
and cook gently for another hour, then pour out.</p>

<p>Boil the soup left in the pot, three hours longer at the
back of the range; add boiling water as the liquid
shrinks. At the end of that time, season well; pour,
without straining, into the stock-pot, and keep in a cold
place. You have now stock for three days—a good
investment of time, materials, and labor.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal and Ham Cutlets, à la Polonaise.</span></h3>

<p>Slice cutlets of veal, of equal size, with as many slices
of corned ham, previously cooked. Flatten the cutlets
with a hatchet; dip in beaten egg, then in cracker-dust,
mixed with minced parsley, pepper, salt, and nutmeg.
Fry in dripping; drain, and lay upon a dish, with alternate
slices of the ham, broiled, and spread with a dressing of
butter and a little French mustard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, and cut the potatoes into dice. Stew, with a
small onion, in enough hot water to cover them. Turn
off most of the water; take out the onion; pour in a cup
of cold milk, and, when this boils, stir in a little chopped
parsley, pepper, salt, and a tablespoonful of butter rolled
in flour. Boil up once, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Mash, and press in a hot colander. Return to the fire,
with a good spoonful of butter, three or four spoonfuls of
milk, and a quarter spoonful of flour, wet up in the milk.
Stir for five minutes; season with pepper and salt, and
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and slice. Scatter fine crumbs in the bottom of
a bake-dish; cover with slices of tomatoes, seasoned with
sugar, pepper, salt, and butter. Cover with crumbs, and
these with tomatoes. Fill the dish in this order, covering
all with crumbs, with bits of butter sprinkled upon them.
Bake, covered, half an hour, and brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bavarian Cream.</span></h3>

<p>1 pint rich milk, and the same of sweet cream; yolks
of 4 eggs; ½ oz. gelatine; 1 small cup of sugar; 2 teaspoonfuls
vanilla or other extract.</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine two hours in enough cold water to
cover it. Heat the milk, and stir in the gelatine until
melted. Pour this upon the beaten yolks and sugar, and
heat until it begins to thicken. It should not boil. Take
from the fire, flavor, and let it cool somewhat. The
cream should have been whipped stiff in a syllabub-churn.
Beat, a spoonful at a time, into the lukewarm custard,
until it is like sponge-cake batter. Pour into a wet
mould, and set on ice to form. It will be formed in a few
hours, if buried in the ice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fancy Macaroni Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from your soup-stock, add a pint of boiling
water, and bring to a slow boil. Strain all through a
colander. Pour off two quarts, through a soup-sieve, into
your soup-kettle, and set over the fire to simmer clear.
Pulp the vegetables left in the colander, and press the
juice out of the meat into the rest of the broth. Remand
this to the stock-pot. When that in the soup-kettle has
boiled ten minutes, and been skimmed carefully, add a
half cup of what is known as “fancy macaroni,” cut into
fantastic shapes, expressly for soups. It should have
been boiled twenty minutes, or until tender, in hot
salted water. Simmer one minute in the soup; add seasoning,
if needed, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Chickens.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and joint a pair of chickens. (Salt the
giblets slightly, and keep on ice until Monday; or, should
the weather be warm, boil them in a pint of water; salt it
well, and set away with the giblets in it.) Scald the
pieces of chicken in boiling water, leaving them in it four
minutes. Lay in ice-water ten minutes, to blanch them.
Add to the quart of boiling water used for scalding them,
the skimmed fat, the necks, and the heads, cleaned by
scalding, picking off the feathers and cutting off the beaks.
Stew for one hour, or until there is but a pint of gravy.
Strain, cool, and take off the fat. Put two tablespoonfuls
of butter into a saucepan, with a very finely minced onion
and a dessertspoonful of flour. When they begin to simmer,
put in the joints of chicken; turn several times in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
the butter, and, after they begin to color, add enough
gravy to keep them from scorching, and stew, covered, at
least an hour. Keep the chicken hot; strain the gravy;
add parsley, pepper, and salt. Have in another saucepan
a half cup of hot milk. Pour upon two beaten eggs,
make very hot, and add to the gravy when you have
taken the latter from the fire. Stir up, and pour over the
chickens.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach à la Crême.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in plenty of hot salted water; drain, and chop fine
upon a board or in a wooden tray. Return to the saucepan
with a tablespoonful of butter, and when hot, add a
little sugar, pepper, salt, nutmeg, and two tablespoonfuls
of cream. Stir until very hot, and serve in a deep dish,
with sippets of fried bread laid over it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Devilled Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart fine ripe tomatoes, pared and cut in thick slices;
yolks of 3 boiled eggs, pounded; 3 tablespoonfuls melted
butter; 4 tablespoonfuls vinegar; 1 raw egg, beaten light;
1 teaspoonful powdered sugar; 1 saltspoonful salt, and
same of made mustard; a <i>soupçon</i> of cayenne.</p>

<p>Rub a tablespoonful of butter into the pounded yolks;
add the seasoning, then the vinegar, and put into a tin or
porcelain saucepan. Heat, and stir in the beaten egg.
Set in boiling water while you heat the rest of the butter
in a frying-pan, and put in the sliced tomatoes. Shake
over the fire eight minutes, turning several times. Lay
the tomatoes upon a hot dish. Strain the butter in which
they were fried into the dressing, stir well, and pour over
the tomatoes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes—Browned.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil, peel, and lay in a baking-pan. Baste with a
little of your soup stock, then with butter, until they are
baked to a nice brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Pears and Cream.</span></h3>

each layer with sugar, and drop a pinch of nutmeg in, now

<h3><span class="smcap">Giblet Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Again skim the contents of your stock-pot. Pour into
the soup-kettle with the water in which the giblets were
boiled. Add seasoning at discretion, and simmer, after the
boil is reached, fifteen minutes. Chop the gizzards very
fine, and put into the soup. Pound the livers to a paste,

<h3><span class="smcap">Quick Lobster Soup.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of stock, made by adding a little water to the
strained remnant of yesterday’s soup. Or, if you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
nothing of this sort, make a broth of coarse bits of veal
and any bones you may have; 1 can of preserved lobster;
1 cup of milk, with a pinch of soda stirred in; 2
tablespoonfuls of butter, rolled in flour; yolks of 2 eggs;
minced parsley, cayenne, and salt.</p>

<p>Heat your broth; skim and season. Put in the lobster,
picked to pieces; simmer ten minutes, then boil up
sharply, once. Heat the milk in a saucepan; stir in the
floured butter; pour upon the beaten yolks. Cook one
minute. Pour the lobster into the tureen; stir in the
thickened milk, and send to table. Pass oyster crackers
and butter with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Lamb.</span></h3>

<p>Lay in the dripping-pan. Dash boiling water over it,
and cook fifteen minutes for each pound. Baste often
with the gravy. Ten minutes before taking it up, dredge
with flour, and baste with butter. Pour the fat from the
top of the gravy; thicken with browned flour, and stir in
a tablespoonful of currant jelly. Boil, and send up in a
boat—salting and peppering to taste.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, drain, and mash in a hot colander. Season with
pepper, salt, and butter; add a few spoonfuls of milk and
two beaten eggs. Pour into a buttered dish, and bake to
a light brown in a quick oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Green Corn cut from the Cob.</span></h3>

<p>Boil the corn until tender. Split each row of grains,
then shave them close to the cob. Butter, pepper, and
salt, and serve hot in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil with the skins on; peel quickly, and lay in a baking-pan,
within a hot oven, a few minutes, to dry, before
piling them upon a flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rock-work.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 5 eggs; 6 tablespoonfuls of sugar;
vanilla, or other essence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span></p>

<p>Heat the milk: pour upon the beaten yolks and sugar.
Cook until the custard begins to thicken. Pour out, and,
when cold, flavor, and pour into a glass bowl. Whip the
whites stiff with two spoonfuls of the sugar, flavor, and
poach by laying, a spoonful at a time, upon boiling milk,
and, carefully withdrawing the spoon from underneath,
leaving the oval mass of <i>méringue</i> floating upon the surface.
Turn it over when one side is done, and, presently,
take it up, and lay upon the custard. Heap them irregularly
on the top, and let all get cold before serving. Pass
light cakes with this custard.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Julienne Soup.</span></h3>

<p>4 lbs. of beef; 2 carrots; 3 turnips; ½ head of cabbage;
1 pint green corn; 1 quart tomatoes; bunch of
herbs; 4 quarts of water; pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Put on the beef, herbs, and water early in the morning,
with some well-cracked bones, if you have them, and let
it boil at the back of the range, very slowly, for five or six
hours. Should the water sink below two-thirds of the
original quantity, replenish from the boiling tea-kettle.
An hour before dinner, strain the soup; put meat and
bones into the stock-pot, and season well. Pour upon
them all that you can spare from the liquor, and leave
enough for to-day. Set this in a cool place. Cool, and
remove the fat from that meant for to-day; return to the
soup-kettle, and put in the vegetables, cut into shreds,
and parboiled for ten minutes. The cabbage should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
been cooked in two waters. The corn must be cut from
the cob, and the tomatoes pared and sliced. Simmer
gently half an hour; season; cook one minute, and pour
out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Lamb.</span></h3>

<p>Trim the remains of your roast into a presentable
shape; garnish with parsley and nasturtium-blooms.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, slice, and stew the tomatoes for twenty minutes.
Strain, and rub through a colander, leaving the hard and
tough parts behind. Put into a saucepan with a little
minced onion, parsley, pepper, salt, and sugar. Bring to
a boil; stir in a good spoonful of butter rolled in flour.
Boil up, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Eggs and Mushrooms.</span></h3>

<p>Slice the rest of the can of mushrooms, opened for
Monday’s stew, into halves. Stew ten minutes in a little
butter, seasoned with pepper and salt, and a very little
water. Drain; put the mushrooms into a pie-dish; break
enough eggs to cover them over the top; pepper, salt,
and scatter bits of butter over them; strew with bread-crumbs,
and bake until the eggs are “set.” Serve in the
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breaded Egg-plant.</span></h3>

<p>Slice nearly half an inch thick; pare each slice and lay
in salt and water one hour. Wipe dry, dip in beaten egg,
then in rolled cracker, and fry to a fine brown in salted
lard or dripping.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>6 tablespoonfuls mashed potato rubbed through a colander;
½ cup rich milk, or cream; 5 eggs, beaten light;
2 tablespoonfuls sugar; 2 tablespoonfuls prepared flour;
juice of 1 lemon, and half the grated peel; ½ grated nutmeg.</p>

<p>Work the cream into the potato; add beaten yolks and
sugar, and whip to a froth. Put in lemon, flour, nutmeg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
and beat three minutes before stirring in the whites.
Drop, by the spoonful, into hot sweet lard, and fry to a
light brown. Drain upon clean, heated paper, sift white
sugar thickly over them and serve at once. Eat if you
like with wine sauce, or with powdered sugar only.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bread-and-Meat Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the top of your cold stock. Add a
pint of boiling water to it, with a sliced onion, and cook
slowly, with the meat in, for forty minutes. Strain, pressing
all the strength out of the meat; stir in a tablespoonful
of catsup, and as much browned flour wet up in cold
water. Have ready a sweetbread, boiled and blanched,
then cut into neat dice. Put these into the soup, and
boil one minute; add a great handful of fried bread, cut
into dice, and pour out. If you have any soup left from
your “Julienne,” heat, strain, and add to this.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Braised Breast of Veal.</span></h3>

<p>Make a deep incision between the ribs and meat: stuff
with a good force-meat made of crumbs, chopped salt pork,
seasoning and a little onion. Skewer the flap of meat
back into its place; put a layer of thin fat salt pork into a
broad saucepan; lay the veal upon it. Pour in a cup of
gravy—from the soup, if you have no other—cover with
more fat pork, or ham, put on a close lid, and cook fifteen
minutes to the pound. Take out the meat; set in a very
quick oven, dredge with flour, and, as it browns, baste
well with butter once. Keep hot upon a dish, while you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
strain the gravy in the braising-pan; thicken it with
browned flour, season to taste, and stir in the juice of
half a lemon, and a glass of claret. Boil up and pour a
little upon the veal, the rest into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower with Sauce.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, seed and quarter. Cook in boiling water salted,
until soft. Mash in a colander; rub through it, and put
back into a saucepan, with a tablespoonful of butter
rolled in flour; a few teaspoonfuls of milk, pepper and
salt to taste. Stir until it begins to bubble; then pour
into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, slice thin, and lay in ice-water half an hour. Dry
between two towels, and fry to a pale brown in hot lard,
a little salt. Drain by shaking in a colander, and serve
in a dish lined with a napkin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Apple Dumplings.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart prepared flour; ¼ lb. suet, powdered; 1 teaspoonful
salt; cold water to make a pretty stiff paste;
fine juicy apples, pared and cored.</p>

<p>Make the paste; roll into a sheet a quarter of an inch
thick; cut into squares; put in the centre of each an
apple; bring the corners together, and pinch the edges.
Have ready some small square cloths, dipped in hot
water, and floured on the inside. Enclose each dumpling
in one of these, leaving room to swell, and tie it up, bag-wise,
with a stout string. Boil one hour; turn out and
serve with plenty of sweet sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Onion Soup Maigre.</span></h3>

<p>3 <i>large</i> onions, sliced; 3 boiled potatoes rubbed through
a colander; 3 tablespoonfuls of rice boiled in 1 quart of
milk; 2 quarts of cold water; 3 tablespoonfuls of butter
rolled in one of flour; chopped parsley; pepper and
salt to taste.</p>

<p>Parboil the onions ten minutes; throw off the water
and let them cool. Then slice, and put over the fire
with the cold water, and boil down to three pints. The
onions should be reduced to a pulp. Strain; rub through
the colander, and set over the fire. When it boils, add
the mashed potatoes, the butter, seasoning, parsley, and
simmer ten minutes. Have the rice boiled soft in the milk
with a pinch of soda; strain it out and add to the soup
in the kettle. Cook gently five minutes, and turn into
the tureen. Pour in the boiling milk, and it is ready.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Blue Fish.</span></h3>

<p>Score the fish down the back, and lay in a dripping-pan.
Pour over it a cup of hot water in which have been
melted two tablespoonfuls of butter. Bake one hour,
basting every ten minutes; twice with butter, twice with
the gravy, and again twice with butter. Take up the fish
and keep hot, while you strain the gravy into a saucepan;
thicken with flour; add a teaspoonful of anchovy paste,
the juice of half a lemon with a little of the grated peel,
pepper and salt. Boil up, pour half over the fish, the
rest into a boat. Garnish the fish with eggs, quartered
lengthwise, lettuce hearts, and quartered lemons.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Imitation Oyster Scallops.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the best pieces from your cold roast veal, in
squares about an inch long and half as thick and wide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
Make a cup of rich drawn butter, and put these into it.
Set over the fire in a saucepan, and add a <i>very</i> little
minced onion and parsley. Heat for ten minutes, but do
not boil. Chop a pickled cucumber quite fine, stir into
the mixture, season with salt and cayenne; fill scallop, or
clam shells, or <i>paté</i>-pans lined with baked paste, with the
scallop; cover with fine crumbs, and brown in a brisk
oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Puff à la Genève.</span></h3>

<p>Whip mashed potatoes light and soft with milk, butter,
and two raw eggs; season with pepper and salt, and beat
in a few spoonfuls of powdered cheese. Pile upon a neat

<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Cakes.</span></h3>

<p>Some good puff-paste; whites of 2 eggs; ½ cup of

powdered sugar; vanilla, or other flavoring.</p>

<p>Roll out the paste as for pies. Cut into squares five
inches across. Have ready well-greased muffin-rings,
three inches in diameter. Lay one in the centre of each
square; turn up the four corners so as to make a cup of
the paste; pinch the tips upon the upper edge of the
ring to keep it in place, and having prepared all, bake in
a quick oven. When done, pull out the rings with care;
brush the paste, outside and in, with the white of egg, and
set back to brown. When cold, wash on the inside with
the jelly, and fill with the whipped cream, sweetened and
flavored.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Vegetable Soup à la Crécy.</span></h3>

<p>2 lbs. of coarse, lean beef, cut into strips; 2 lbs. of
knuckle of veal, chopped to pieces; 2 lbs. of mutton
bones, and the bones left from your cold veal, cracked to
splinters; 1 lb. of lean ham; 4 large carrots; 2 turnips;
2 onions; bunch of herbs; 3 tablespoonfuls of butter,
and 2 of flour; 1 tablespoonful of sugar; salt and pepper;
7 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Put on meat, bones, herbs and water, and cook slowly
five hours. Strain the soup, of which there should be
five quarts. Season meat and bones, and put into the
stock-pot with three quarts of the liquor. Save this for
days to come. While the soup for to-day is cooling that
you may take off the fat, put the butter into a frying-pan
with the sliced carrots, turnips, and onions, and fry to a
light brown. Now, add a pint of the skimmed stock, and
stew the vegetables tender; stir in the flour wet with
water; and put all, with your cooled stock, over the fire
in the soup-kettle. Season with sugar, cayenne and salt;
boil five minutes; rub through a colander, then a soup-sieve,
heat almost to boiling, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Glazed Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Soak and boil a ham twenty minutes to the pound, and
let it get almost cold in the water. Skin it neatly, and
coat with a paste made of a cup of cracker-crumbs, one
of milk, two beaten eggs, and seasoned with pepper. Set
the ham in the oven until the glazing is browned, moistening,
now and then, with a few spoonfuls of cream. Wind
frilled paper about the shank, and garnish with parsley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Pull out and tear to pieces the hearts of lettuce; pile
in a salad-bowl; sprinkle with white sugar, and season
with oil, pepper, salt, and vinegar, in the proportions so
often given. Toss up with a silver fork.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Lyonnaise.</span></h3>

<p>See Saturday, First Week in September.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cabbage au Gratin.</span></h3>

<p>Quarter a small white cabbage, and boil tender in pot-liquor
taken from your ham. Let it get cold; chop and
season with pepper, salt, a good spoonful of butter, three
or four of milk, and beat smooth with two raw eggs. Put
into a buttered dish; strew thickly with crumbs; wet
these with pot-liquor, and bake, covered, forty-five minutes,—then
brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peach Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>12 ripe peaches, pared, stoned, and stewed in a little
water; 1 cup bread-crumbs; 2 cups of boiling milk; 5
tablespoonfuls of sugar; 5 beaten eggs; tablespoonful of
butter.</p>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the hot milk; stir in the butter, the
beaten eggs and sugar, at last the cooled and mashed
peaches. Beat up light; put into a buttered pudding-mould;
set in a pan of boiling water; cover, and cook one
hour in a good oven. Turn out, and eat with sweetened
cream.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tapioca Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Remove the fat from your soup-stock; pour off two
quarts; heat, and strain through coarse muslin back into
the pot. Stir in half a cup of soaked tapioca—the fine-grained—simmer
until clear; add half a glass of brown
sherry, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricassee of Ducks.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and cut the ducks into four pieces each.
Flour, and fry them to a light brown. Drain; put into a
saucepan, with a cup of gravy (a little of your soup-stock
will do), a glass of claret, some chopped parsley, a
small onion, minced, salt and pepper. Cover closely, and
stew half an hour, or until the ducks are tender. Take
them out; strain, and set the gravy in cold water to throw
up the fat. Take it off; thicken with browned flour wet
with water; boil up, and, having laid the ducks upon a
flat dish, pour the gravy over them. This is a very fine
fricassee.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomatoes in a Mould.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and slice eight tomatoes. Put them in a coarse
cloth, and press out most of the juice into a bowl. Save
this carefully. Chop the tomatoes; mix in two tablespoonfuls
of fine crumbs, pepper, salt, sugar, and a tablespoonful
of melted butter. Stir up well, and put into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
buttered mould. Fit on the top, and set in a pot of boiling
water. Keep at a fast boil for one hour. When
done, turn out upon a flat dish, and pour over them this
sauce: Heat the tomato-juice; stir in a tablespoonful of
butter rolled in flour, season with pepper, sugar, and salt;
boil one minute.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>See Tuesday, Fourth Week in September.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Rissoles.</span></h3>

<p>Mash the potatoes fine, and whip with a fork, adding
pepper, butter, and milk, lastly, a beaten egg. Have
ready one-third as much chopped ham as you have potato;
mix all together; make into round balls a little larger than
an English walnut; dip in egg, then in cracker-dust, and
fry quickly in plenty of good dripping. Drain upon
paper, and serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ruby’s Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Some good puff-paste; ¼ lb. of stale sponge-cakes,
pounded; 1 cup of milk; 1 tablespoonful of butter; 1
teaspoonful corn-starch wet in milk; yolks of 2 eggs; 1
heaping spoonful of sugar; a little nutmeg; whites of 3
eggs; strawberry, or other sweet jam.</p>

<p>Line a pie-dish with the paste. Put a layer of jam at
the bottom, then one, half an inch thick, of the pounded
cakes. Heat the milk; stir in the butter and corn-starch;
boil one minute. When cold, whip in the yolks and
sugar, with nutmeg, and beat light. Fill the dish with this
mixture, and bake about half an hour. Then cover with
a <i>méringue</i> made of the three whites, a little sugar, and
the juice of half a lemon. Spread quickly, and shut the
oven-door until it has “set” well. Do this on Saturday,
and you will have a delightful Sunday pudding. It is also
good warm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span></p>

<p>Add a pint of boiling water to your soup-stock, and
cook, with the meat in, half an hour, at the back of the
range. Strain, squeezing the meat to a tasteless mass in
a coarse cloth. Return the soup to the fire, stir in a cup
of rice, boiled as I shall presently direct, and season to
taste. Finally, put in a teaspoonful of curry-powder, wet
up with water, and bring to a boil; then pour out. If
you do not like curry, you will find the soup very good
without it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breaded Mutton Chops—Baked.</span></h3>

<p>Trim off fat and skin; dip in egg, then in rolled cracker,
mixed with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and powdered parsley.
Lay upon a dripping-pan. Pour over each a teaspoonful
of melted butter, and set in the oven. When they begin
to hiss, baste with hot water, in which has been boiled a
little onion, mixed with butter. If the oven be good,
half an hour should be enough for them. They should
be tender, juicy, and brown. Baste six or seven times.
Strain the gravy, and thicken with browned flour. Add a
little lemon-juice and tomato catsup, and send up in a
boat. Lay the chops around your spinach.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach.</span></h3>

<p>Boil twenty minutes in plenty of boiling salt water.
Drain, and chop very fine. Return to the saucepan, with
a little sugar, pepper, salt, and a tablespoonful of butter
rolled in flour. Stir until hot, and dry enough to be
moulded. Turn out; shape into a flat-topped ridge upon
a hot dish, and lay the chops at the base.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Whipped Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Whip boiled potatoes to creamy lightness with a fork;
beat in butter, milk, pepper, and salt; at last, the frothed
white of an egg. Toss irregularly upon a dish; set in the
oven two minutes, to re-heat, but do not let it color.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Rice, with Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Dilute what gravy you have left from your duck fricassee
with water, or make a weak broth of the duck bones,
boiled with a little lean ham in a quart of water, until you
have less than a pint left. Or, add hot water to the remains
of yesterday’s soup, and strain it. But get a pint
of weak gravy from <i>somewhere</i>, and, having soaked a cup
of rice in just enough water to cover it, for an hour, put
it over the fire in a farina-kettle, pour in the gravy, and
cook until the rice is soft, shaking up from the bottom,
now and then, but never stirring. Take out some for
your soup. Heap the rest in a deep dish, and pour over
it a cup of drawn butter, in which have been stirred a
beaten egg and two tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce.
N. B.—The gravy should be well seasoned.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Charlotte.</span></h3>

<p>Beat two cups of nice apple sauce, well sweetened and
flavored, to a high froth, with the whipped whites of three
eggs. Make into a mound in a glass dish, and cover with
lady’s-fingers, or other small sponge-cakes, fitted neatly together.
Send around sugar and cream with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee.</span></h3>

<p>Pass, while you are still at table, or afterward, in the
library or sitting-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Barley Broth.</span></h3>

<p>2 lbs. of lean mutton, cut into strips; ½ lb. lean ham,
or a cracked ham-bone; 1 onion; 1 turnip; ½ cup of
barley, soaked two hours in a little tepid water; 3 quarts
of cold water; pepper, salt, and chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Cook meat, bones, and the sliced vegetables together
in the water three hours. Strain, cool, and skim the
broth; season; put back over the fire, with the barley,
and stew gently half an hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Have a piece of beef cut from what is known as the
“roll” of the shin. It should weigh between three and
four pounds. Put into a large saucepan, with a minced
onion, and cover completely with water, in which pour a
cup of your soup, so as to make a weak broth. Pepper
and salt the meat all over before it goes in. Cover, and
cook very slowly an hour and a half. Turn the beef, and
cook as long again, making three hours in all. It should
have been so slowly cooked as to be tender as butter,
yet not broken at the edges. Dish, wash all over with
melted butter, and set in the oven three minutes. Then
arrange the macaroni about it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni.</span></h3>

<p>Boil half a pound of macaroni, broken into short pieces,
in hot salted water, ten minutes; drain, pepper and salt,
and lay about the beef. Cool and skim the gravy after
taking out the beef; strain into a saucepan, thicken with
browned flour, add a little French mustard; boil once,
pour half over the beef, the rest into a boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, quarter, and cook tender, in boiling salted water.
Mash in a colander, pressing hard. Stir in butter, pepper
and salt, and turn into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kidney Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Shell; put on in boiling water with an inch or so of fat
salt pork, and cook tender. Drain well, salt, pepper, and
butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Southern Rice Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart fresh, sweet milk; 1 cup of raw rice; 2 tablespoonfuls
of butter; 1 cup of sugar; 5 beaten eggs; 1
teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel; a pinch of cinnamon
and same of mace.</p>

<p>Soak the rice in the milk two hours. Heat in a farina-kettle
until the rice is soft. Cream butter and sugar; stir
in the beaten eggs and whip hard. When the rice is lukewarm,
put all together, and bake in a buttered mould
about forty-five minutes. Eat warm with sauce, or cold
with sugar and cream.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Squirrel Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Skin, clean, and cut into quarters a pair of fine gray
squirrels. Fry a large onion, sliced, in dripping; take it
out, and fry the squirrels in the same fat. Put them then
into a soup-pot with the onion, a sliced turnip, a sliced
carrot, a slice—thick—of lean ham, some parsley, and
two blades of mace; add three quarts of water; cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
closely and boil gently three hours; take out the pieces
of squirrel, and put away for a breakfast dish. A tolerable
fricassee can be made by warming it up in drawn
butter, then adding a beaten egg.</p>

<p><i>Revenons à nos moutons</i>—in this case, our soup. Rub
the vegetables through the colander; cool, skim and season
the broth. Heat again; add a tablespoonful of butter
cut up in flour, a tablespoonful of catsup, the juice of
half a lemon, a glass of claret, boil up and pour into the
tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricassee of Calf’s Tongues.</span></h3>

<p>Boil the tongues one hour. Pare, and cut into thick
slices. Roll these in flour, and fry in dripping five minutes.
Put the tongues into a saucepan; add sliced onion,
thyme and parsley. Cover with a cupful of your soup or
other gravy. Simmer half an hour, covered tightly. Take
up the tongues and keep them warm; strain the gravy;
thicken, put in four or five <i>thin</i> slices of lemon, from
which the peel has been taken; boil one minute, and pour
over the fricassee.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Egg-plant.</span></h3>

<p>1 fine egg-plant; 2 eggs; ½ cup of milk; flour for thin
batter, salt, and fat for frying.</p>

<p>Slice, and pare each slice. Lay in salt and water one
hour; dry between two towels and dip each slice in a
batter made of the materials above given. Fry in hot fat
to a good brown. Drain well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, quarter, and cook soft in boiling salted water.
Drain, mash smooth in a heated colander, work in butter,
pepper and salt, and serve in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stripped Potatoes, Stewed.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, and cut into lengthwise strips; cover with boiling
water, and stew twenty minutes. Turn off nearly all
the water; put in a cupful of cold milk, with salt and
pepper. When this boils, stir in a spoonful of butter,
rolled in flour, with a little chopped parsley. Cook two
minutes, and serve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jelly Custards and Cake.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 5 eggs; 1 cup of sugar; vanilla or
other flavoring; crab-apple and currant jelly.</p>

<p>Heat the milk; pour upon the beaten eggs and sugar.
Heat and stir until it begins to thicken. When cold,
flavor; fill your custard-cups nearly to the tops, and lay a
slice of firm, bright jelly upon each—tart upon some,
sweet upon the rest. Eat with cake.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Marrow-bone Soup.</span></h3>

<p>4 lbs. of marrow-bones, broken to pieces, and the marrow
left in (beef-bones are best, but others may be used);
1 lb. salt pork, or ham-bones; 2 onions; 2 stalks of celery;
3 tomatoes; 4 parboiled potatoes, sliced; bunch of
herbs; pepper and salt; 5 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Put on the bones in the water, and cook slowly four
hours, leaving three quarts of water. Strain into a bowl;
surround this with cold water, to make the fat rise; take
this off, and return the soup to the fire, with the parboiled
potatoes and the sliced onions—which should have lain ten
minutes in scalding water, to take off their strong taste—the
tomatoes, and herbs. Boil slowly until you can rub
the vegetables through a colander. Add them to the
soup; season; heat almost to the third boil, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Chickens.</span></h3>

<p>Draw, wash, and stuff a pair of full-grown chickens.
Truss, and lay in a dripping-pan. Dash a cup of boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
water over them, and roast one hour, or until tender and
brown. Baste very often—twice, after they begin to
brown, with butter. Sprinkle the giblets with salt, and
set away for to-morrow. Pour the gravy, after the chickens
are taken up, into a bowl, set in cold water, and take
off the fat. Put into a saucepan, thicken with browned
flour; season; boil once, and serve in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Shell; cook forty minutes in boiling salted water;
drain, pepper, salt, and butter, and serve in a vegetable-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Broiled Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Slice cold boiled potatoes lengthwise, and rather thick.
Lay between the wires of an oyster-broiler, and cook at a
hot fire to a light brown on both sides. Sprinkle with
pepper and salt; lay a bit of butter upon each, and eat
hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Raw Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, slice, and put into a salad-dish. Mix in a bowl a
teaspoonful of sugar, half as much, each, of made mustard,
pepper, and salt; add, gradually, two tablespoonfuls of
salad-oil, and the yolk of an egg. Beat to a cream, and
whip in, a little at a time, five tablespoonfuls of vinegar.
Pour over the tomatoes, and set the salad upon ice until
needed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Squash Pie.</span></h3>

<p>1 pint of boiled, mashed, and strained squash; 2 cups
of milk; 1 cup of sugar; 4 eggs, beaten light; ½ teaspoonful
of ginger, and 1 teaspoonful mixed mace and
cinnamon.</p>

<p>Beat all well together, and bake in open shells.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span></p>

Amber Pudding.<br />
——<br />
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cat-fish Soup.</span></h3>

<p>6 fresh-water cat-fish, in weight about half a pound
each; 1 pint of milk; 4 tablespoonfuls of butter; 1 tablespoonful
corn-starch, wet with cold milk; 1 onion; 1 teaspoonful
essence of celery, and same of anchovy sauce;
2 tablespoonfuls chopped celery; 2 beaten eggs; 3 quarts
of cold water.</p>

<p>Cut up the fish, when you have skinned them and removed
the heads. Put into a pot, with the onion and
water, and boil until the fish are in rags. Strain, return
to the pot, add the corn-starch, and, when this has thickened,
the butter, a teaspoonful at a time. Season with
pepper, salt, celery, and anchovy, and pour into the
tureen. Have ready the hot milk, mixed and cooked one
minute with the beaten eggs and parsley. Add this to
the hot soup; stir well, and serve. Pass sliced lemon and
oyster crackers with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Oysters.</span></h3>

<p>3 pints of oysters; 1 cup of rolled cracker; 2 tablespoonfuls
of butter; pepper; salt; juice of a lemon.
(Cayenne pepper is best for this purpose.)</p>

<p>Butter a neat pudding-dish. Strain the oysters from
their liquor; spread upon a cloth; take up, one by one,
and put on a drop or so of lemon-juice; roll in cracker-dust,
pepper, and salt, and lay in the dish. When the
bottom is covered, drop bits of butter here and there, and
proceed to put on another layer of crumbs and seasoned
oysters. Having filled your dish, strew cracker-dust over
all; stick bits of butter upon it, and wet well with a cup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
of oyster-liquor. Bake, covered, half an hour, or until
the juice bubbles up at the edges; then brown upon the
upper grating of the oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roulettes of Chicken.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off the meat from the skeletons of your roast chickens.
Put on the bones and stuffing in a quart of water,
and stew down to one pint. Meantime, chop the chicken
meat fine; mix with one-fourth as much fine crumbs, wet
with yesterday’s gravy; add the gizzards, boiled and
minced, and the boiled livers pounded; season to taste;
bind all with beaten egg; make into balls, and dip into a
batter made of three-quarters of a cup of milk, two eggs,
about one scant cup of prepared flour, or just enough to
make rather thin batter, salted to taste. Fry, as you dip
each roulette, in hot lard, or dripping; drain off the fat,
and pile them upon a dish. Cool, strain, and season the
gravy from the bones; thicken, should it need it; boil
once, and serve in a boat to go around with the roulettes.
They are a nice <i>entrée</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beets.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off the tops and wash. Boil one hour in hot, salted
water; scrape and slice. Dish and pour over them a
mixture of one tablespoonful of melted butter heated,
with one of vinegar, and seasoned with pepper and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, and let them get cold. Then, scrape off the
skins; slice lengthwise, and fry to a light brown in good
dripping or salted lard.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Amber Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>6 eggs beaten light; 1 cup of sugar, creamed with ½
cup of butter; juice of a lemon, and half the grated peel;
a good pinch of nutmeg; puff paste.</p>

<p>Mix sugar, butter, eggs, together; put into a custard-kettle,
set in hot water, and stir until it thickens. Stir in
lemon and nutmeg, and let it get cold. Put a strip of
paste around the edge of a pie-plate; print it prettily;
pour in the cold mixture, and bake in a steady, not too
hot oven. Eat cold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ox-tail Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 ox-tails; 3 lbs. lean beef; 4 carrots; 3 onions; thyme
and parsley; 8 quarts of cold water; 4 tablespoonfuls of
butter for frying; pepper, salt, and browned flour.</p>

<p>Cut the tails into short pieces, and fry to a good brown.
Take them from the pan, and fry two sliced carrots and
two sliced onions in the same butter. Lay the meat, cut
into strips, in the bottom of a soup-pot; upon them the
fried onions and carrots, upon these the ox-tails. Grate
the two whole carrots, and slice the whole onion; cover
the tails with them. Put in the herbs, and pour in the
water. It is a good plan to fry the tails, onions, and
carrots overnight, as the soup should have at least six
hours’ boil. There should be six quarts of soup. Strain
it off. Put meat and tails into your stock-pot, season
well, and pour on four quarts of the soup. Keep in a
cold place for future use.</p>

<p>Rub the vegetables through the colander into the portion
reserved for to-day; cool and skim; put back over
the fire; bring to a boil; season and skim; then thicken
with browned flour—about two tablespoonfuls—wet up
with cold water. Simmer five minutes and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corned Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Cook in plenty of cold water at the back of the range.
Fast boiling toughens meat. Boil eighteen or twenty
minutes to the pound. Take out, wipe quickly, and rub
all over with butter. Send horseradish sauce around with
it. Save the pot-liquor.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Peel and quarter the turnips. Dip out a pint of pot-liquor
from your boiling beef; strain, heat, and skim it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
and while boiling hot, put in the turnips. Cook soft, but
not to breaking; drain, and lay about the beef in its dish,
with parsley sprigs or cresses, as an edging.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Whip light with a fork until dry and mealy; then beat
in butter, milk, and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Horseradish Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Heat and strain a cupful of the beef pot-liquor. Stir into
it a tablespoonful of butter, rolled in a teaspoonful of flour.
When it thickens, take from the fire and whip in the
whisked white of an egg; then two tablespoonfuls of
grated horseradish, and the juice of a lemon. Set in boiling
water until wanted.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bubble Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of fresh milk; 5 eggs, well beaten; 3 tablespoonfuls
of corn-starch; 1 tablespoonful of sugar; nutmeg
to taste; pinch of soda in the milk.</p>

<p>Scald the milk; stir in the corn-starch; cook one minute,
and pour upon the beaten eggs and sugar. Season,
whip up well; pour into a round-bottomed mould, well
buttered; fit on the top; set in a pot of boiling water;
boil three-quarters of an hour; turn out upon a dish, and
eat with wine sauce. It will almost certainly break in
two on the way to table, hence the name.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clear Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from your soup stock; dip out two quarts,
or more, as you may need, warm it over the fire with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
onion, simmer and skim until clear; strain; add two tablespoonfuls
of sparkling gelatine soaked in a very little
water; put in, also, a teaspoonful of essence of celery,
the juice of a lemon, and a glass of good wine. Boil up
once, take off the film from the top, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chickens and Mushrooms.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and wash a pair of fine fowls, and stuff their
bodies with chopped mushrooms, in which a teaspoonful
of onion has been mixed. Fill the craws with the usual
dressing of seasoned crumbs with the addition of the
pounded yolk of an egg. Lay the trussed chickens in a
pot, and pour over them a large cupful of your soup-stock
diluted with as much boiling water. Simmer until
tender. Take up and keep the chickens hot. Strain the
gravy; season to taste, skim off the fat; stir in a tablespoonful
of flour wet with milk; boil and stir two minutes
to thicken; add half a cup of hot milk; stir in well,
and pour some over the chickens; the rest into a boat.
Save the giblets for to-morrow.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Squash au Gratin.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, quarter, and boil the squash; mash and press to
get out the water; beat in a good spoonful of butter with
pepper, salt, and a little cream. Pour into a bake-dish;
strew with fine crumbs, and bake in a quick oven until
these are slightly browned.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Creamed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Put into a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter, a
little minced parsley, salt and pepper to taste. Stir to
hissing, add a small cup of milk (with a pinch of soda),
and, when hot, a teaspoonful of flour. Stir until it boils;
chop cold boiled potatoes, put into the cream, and serve
so soon as they begin to boil.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breaded Egg-Plant.</span></h3>

<p>Slice, and pare the slices. Lay in strong salt water one
hour; wipe dry; dip in beaten egg, and roll in pounded
cracker. Fry to a good brown; drain well, and dish hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spanish Cream.</span></h3>

<p>½ box of gelatine; 1 quart of milk; yolks of 3 eggs; 1
small cup of sugar; flavor with vanilla, or other essence.</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine one hour in the milk. Put into a
farina-kettle, and stir as it warms. When hot, pour over
the beaten yolks and sugar; put back into the kettle, and
heat to scalding. Strain through tarlatan; flavor and
pour into a wet mould. Do this on Saturday, and set in
a cold place. Eat with cream, or without.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Vermicelli Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Add the remains of yesterday’s soup to what remains
in your stock-pot. Dilute with a little boiling water, and
heat all to a boil. Strain out the ox-tails, etc., which
have done such good service. Although it <i>is</i> Monday,
make time to put them into a pot, by and by, with the
skeletons of yesterday’s chickens. Cover them with the
skimmed liquor in which the corned beef was cooked on
Saturday, and warm slowly to a boil, then, put back into
the stock-pot for to-morrow’s soup. As to to-day’s soup,
add seasoning to taste; boil up and skim, and, ten minutes
before serving, drop in a handful of vermicelli, broken
small, and cooked ten minutes in boiling water. Boil up
once and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Chops.</span></h3>

large end of each overlapping the small end of that beyond
it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, and lay in a moderate oven. When they are soft
between the fingers, they are done. Serve in the skins.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, slice, and stew twenty minutes. Then season
with pepper, salt, and sugar; stir in a good lump of butter
rolled in flour; simmer ten minutes, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Savory Rice Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup of boiled rice; ½ cup of gravy from yesterday’s
chickens; the giblets, boiled and chopped; 2 eggs; 3
tablespoonfuls of milk; 1 teaspoonful of flour; pepper
and salt.</p>

<p>Beat the eggs into the rice; add gravy, milk, seasonings,
giblets; lastly, the flour wet up in milk. Beat well;
pour into a mould; set in a dripping-pan of hot water,
and cook one hour. Turn out, and eat hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oranges, Bananas, and Pears.</span></h3>

<p>Atone to the so-by-herself-considered queen of the lower
realms for such a “quare lot of mussing on a washin’
day,” by serving a pretty fruit dessert, and seeing to it that
it <i>is</i> pretty and good.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Green Bean Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from your soup-stock; add a quart of
boiling water, and strain from the <i>débris</i>. Put over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
fire; boil, and take off the scum; then put in a scant
quart of fresh kidney or Lima beans. Boil slowly at the
back of the range until the beans break to pieces. Rub
through a colander; season as required; put in a teaspoonful
of essence of celery, and pour upon dice of fried
bread already in the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef à la Reine.</span></h3>

<p>Have a small round of beef, or a piece weighing six or
seven pounds cut from the round, bound into a compact
shape by a broad strip of muslin, as wide as it is high.
Make holes clear through it by passing a keen knife perpendicularly
through the round—about an inch apart.
Fill one-third of these with chopped fat bacon; one-third
with a mixture of crumbs, onion, and herbs; the other
with minced oysters. Rub the top of the round with allspice,
nutmeg, salt, and pepper, working the mixture well
into the incisions, as well as into the flesh. Set the stuffed
round in a dripping-pan; pour over it a cup of your soup-stock
(before the beans are added), mixed with a glass of
claret. Dredge the top with flour when the gravy has
soaked in, and cook, in a moderate oven, two hours or
more, basting very often. Undo the bandage; dish the
beef; strain the gravy; thicken with browned flour, and
serve in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Purée of Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Peel, slice, and boil in hot salted water. Rub through
a colander; return to the fire; mix in a great spoonful
of butter rolled in a little flour, two tablespoonfuls of
cream, and season with pepper and salt. Stir ten minutes,
and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Cakes.</span></h3>

<p>Stir into a cup of mashed potatoes a tablespoonful of
butter (heaping), a beaten egg, two tablespoonfuls of milk,
salt, and a tablespoonful of prepared flour. Roll out,
half an inch thick; cut round or square; prick with a
fork, and bake to a nice brown. Eat hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Pull the best leaves to pieces; heap in a salad-bowl, and
pour over it a dressing made according to the receipt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
given on Thursday of First Week in October, but leaving
out the raw egg.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Custard Bread Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups fine dry crumbs; 1 quart of milk; 5 eggs, beaten
light; 1 tablespoonful corn-starch; 1 teaspoonful of salt,
and ½ teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in the milk; flavor
to taste.</p>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk, and heat in a custard-kettle
to a boil. Add the corn-starch wet with cold milk,
cook one minute, turn out and beat hard. When smooth
and almost cold, whip in the yolks, the flavoring, lastly,
the whites. Boil in a buttered mould an hour and a half.
Eat hot with sweet sauce. It is excellent.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Cheap Soup.</span></h3>

<p>1 lb. of lean beef, cut into strips; 2 onions; 2 turnips;
½ cup of rice; 6 tomatoes; 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar;
pepper, salt; 2 teaspoonfuls essence of celery; dripping
for frying; 3 quarts of water; bunch of herbs.</p>

<p>Put dripping and sugar into a soup-pot; when they
heat, add the meat and sliced onions. Stir until nicely
browned. Add the water, the turnips, and herbs. Cook
one hour; take off the fat; put in tomatoes and rice, and
simmer two hours. Season to taste, cook ten minutes,
and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cannelon of Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Chop the remains of yesterday’s beef; mix with quarter
of a pound of minced ham; season with pepper, salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
grated lemon-peel, and a little onion. Moisten with yesterday’s
gravy, with a little flour stirred in, and bind with
a beaten egg or two. Make some pie-paste, or such as
you would use for dumplings; roll into an oblong sheet;
put the beef-mince in the middle, and make the pastry
into a long roll, enclosing the meat. Close at the ends
with round caps of pastry, the edges pinched well together.
Lay in a dripping-pan—the joined side of the roll downward,
and bake to a good brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Browned Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, and peel neatly. Lay in a dripping-pan, and baste
often with good dripping, or butter, until glossy and delicately
browned.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hominy Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups of boiled, fine-grained hominy; 2 beaten eggs;
2 tablespoonfuls melted butter; salt to taste.</p>

<p>Work the hominy smooth with the butter; beat in the
eggs with a wooden spoon; salt, and make into long
balls, with floured hands. Flatten at the ends, roll in
flour, and fry to a golden brown in lard or dripping.
Drain, and pile upon a flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a fine cauliflower in hot salted water. Drain, put
into a deep dish, blossom upward, and pour over it a cup
of rich drawn butter, with the juice of half a lemon
stirred in.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Claret Jelly.</span></h3>

<p>1 package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked one hour in a large
cup of water; 2 cups of sugar; 2 cups of claret; 1 pint
of boiling water; juice of 1 lemon; a pinch of mace.</p>

<p>Put gelatine, lemon, sugar, and mace together, and
cover half an hour. Pour on the boiling water; stir until
the gelatine is melted, and strain through a flannel bag.
Add the wine, and strain through double flannel into a
wet mould. Set in ice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Egg Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 lbs. lean ham; 1 lb. lean veal, cut into dice; 1 carrot;
1 onion; 1 grated turnip; 1 boiled potato, mashed;
chopped parsley; 3 quarts of water; 6 or 8 eggs.</p>

<p>Cut up the meat, onion, and carrot, and put on with
herbs and water to come to a slow boil. Keep this up
for three hours and a half. The water should not lose
more than one-third. Strain off the liquor; cool and
skim. Put over the fire, with the grated turnip and
mashed potato. Season, and simmer half an hour. Pour
into the tureen, and lay upon the top of the soup as many
poached eggs, trimmed round, as there are persons to be
served.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Steak, Broiled.</span></h3>

<p>Flatten a large steak, and lard it with thin strips of fat
salt pork, bringing all the ends out on one side of the
steak. You can do this with a knife and your fingers, by
making two holes for each lardoon, and making a loop of
it under the steak; but it is better to have a larding-needle.
Broil upon a greased gridiron; lay upon a hot dish;
put upon it a little warmed butter, seasoned with pepper,
salt, and French mustard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Purée of Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash boiled potatoes; rub through a colander; add a
few spoonfuls of milk, one of butter rolled in flour, and
stir over the fire five minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Pour into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Macaroni.</span></h3>

<p>Break half a pound of macaroni into inch lengths, and
cook twenty minutes in boiling salt water. Drain; cover
the bottom of a buttered dish with it; strew with grated
cheese and butter-bits, pepper and salt lightly, and put in
another layer of macaroni. Fill the dish in this way;
strew cheese and butter on top; pour in half a cup of
milk, and bake, covered, half an hour—then, brown
quickly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bavarian Salad.</span></h3>

<p>2 <i>small</i> onions; 2 heads of lettuce, pulled to pieces;
1 boiled beet, cold and sliced; 3 tablespoonfuls salad-oil;
2 of vinegar; yolk of 1 raw egg; 1 saltspoonful of salt,
and same of made mustard.</p>

<p>Chop the onions exceedingly small, and beat into the
whipped egg the salt, mustard, the oil, last of all, the
vinegar. Put the lettuce into a dish; cover with the
beet-root, and pour on the dressing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Cream Pie.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup of sugar; 1 tablespoonful of butter; 1 egg; 1
lemon, pared carefully, even to the white rind, and the
seeds removed; 1 tablespoonful corn-starch, wet in cold
water; 1 cup of boiling water.</p>

<p>Stir the corn-starch into the water, and pour over the
creamed butter and sugar. When cold, add the minced
lemon and grated peel, with the egg. Beat hard and
bake in open shells of paste. Eat cold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Turnip Soup.</span></h3>

<p>12 turnips; 4 tablespoonfuls of butter; 2 tablespoonfuls
of flour; 1 quart of milk; 2 quarts of water; 1
onion; chopped parsley; salt and cayenne.</p>

<p>Pare, slice, and put the turnips on with the onion in
the water. Cook soft, pulp through a colander, and
return, with the water, to the fire. Melt the butter in a
saucepan, stir in the flour, and cook ten minutes, stirring
all the time in one direction. Add the milk, stirring it in
gradually; take from the fire. Simmer the turnip <i>purée</i>
five minutes after adding seasoning and chopped parsley;
pour in the thickened milk, boil up once, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Patés.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of oysters, minced fine with a sharp knife; 1
cup of rich drawn butter, based upon milk; cayenne and
pepper to taste.</p>

<p>Stir the minced oysters into the drawn butter and cook
five minutes in a farina-kettle. Have ready some shapes
of pastry, baked in <i>paté</i>-pans, then slipped out. Fill
these with the mixture; set in the oven two minutes to
heat, and send to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rissoles of Sweetbreads.</span></h3>

<p>Boil and blanch three fine sweetbreads. Mince, and
add one-third the quantity of fine crumbs. Season with
pepper and salt, a little nutmeg, and two beaten eggs.
Work and beat smooth; roll into long balls; flour these
well. Have ready a little gravy in a saucepan, well-seasoned;
add as much drawn butter. When it boils, put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
in the rissoles, a few at a time, and cook ten minutes.
Drain off the gravy; transfer the sweetbreads carefully to
a hot dish; pour the gravy upon a beaten egg; heat to
thickening, and pour over the rissoles.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chopped Cabbage.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a firm cabbage in two waters—having taken off
the outer leaves and quartered it. Chop very fine; put
into a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter and the
same of vinegar, with pepper and salt. Stir in the cabbage,
and when very hot, dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes—Browned.</span></h3>

<p>Mash in the usual way; heap roughly upon a greased
pie-plate; set in a quick oven, and when delicately
browned, slip to another dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quince Soufflé.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, slice, and stew the fruit soft. Sweeten well, and
rub through a colander. Put into a glass dish. Make a
custard of 1 pint of milk, 3 yolks, and half a cup of
sugar. When cold, pour, two inches deep, upon the
quince. Whip the whites of the eggs light with sugar and
lemon-juice, and heap upon the custard.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Please consult receipt for Wednesday, Third Week in
March. There should be enough for two days at least.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hot Pot.</span></h3>

<p>2 lbs. of lean veal; calf’s brains from your boiled head;
1 pint of oysters; pepper—cayenne is best; a <i>little</i> minced
onion; salt; a tablespoonful of butter; ¼ lb. of oyster
crackers, buttered and split; minced parsley and lemon-peel.</p>

<p>Cut the veal into squares, and parboil for twenty minutes.
Put a layer in the bottom of a buttered bake-dish;
season well; sprinkle on a little onion, and put a layer
of split crackers next. The brains should be beaten up
with a raw egg, and seasoned. Drop in small spoonfuls
upon the crackers; next, put a few oysters, strewed with
pepper, salt and butter-bits; more veal, and so on to the
top, which should be crackers. Fill the dish with the
water in which the veal was boiled, seasoned, and an
equal quantity of oyster liquor. Cover closely, and bake
in a moderate oven an hour and a half. Serve in the
dish. It should not be uncovered for browning.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower à la Crême.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a fine cauliflower in plenty of hot salted water,
having tied it up in a bit of mosquito-net. When done,
put into a deep dish, blossom upward, and pour over it a
cupful of drawn butter in which has been beaten, and then
cooked, a raw egg.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Parsnips.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape, slice lengthwise, and put on to boil in hot
salted water. They will take more than an hour to cook.

nutmeg and rose-water to taste.</p>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk, and add to the creamed
butter and sugar, and the beaten yolks. Beat well; put
in the corn-starch; the whisked white; at last the grated
cocoanut. Beat one minute; pour into a buttered pudding
dish, and bake in a moderate oven forty-five minutes.

<h3><span class="smcap">Yesterday’s Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Your mock-turtle soup will be even better the second
day than on the first. Take off the fat; dip out enough
of the stock for your family, and bring slowly to a boil.
You can make a little variety in it by serving the force-meat
balls the first day; the meat dice the second, or
<i>vice versa</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Leg of Lamb.</span></h3>

<p>Lay in the dripping-pan; pour a cup of boiling water
over it, and roast steadily, twelve minutes to the pound,
basting very often. Ten minutes before taking it up,
dredge with flour, and baste well with butter to make a
brown froth. Lay on a dish, and keep hot. Pour the
gravy into a basin set in very cold water. This will send
the grease to the top. Remove it all; pour the brown
gravy into a saucepan; thicken with browned flour; season,
boil once, and serve in a boat. Pass currant-jelly with
lamb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups mashed potatoes, free from lumps; 2 beaten
eggs; 1 tablespoonful melted butter; salt and pepper to
taste; a little flour.</p>

<p>Mix all well together; heat, and stir over the fire until
smoking hot. Let it get cold, and make into small rolls
flattened at the ends. Roll in flour and fry to a good
brown. Drain off upon paper and eat hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil until a fork will go easily into the largest. Skin,
and lay in a bake-pan in the oven a few minutes to dry—then
serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Egg-plant.</span></h3>

<p>See Wednesday, First Week in October.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Snow.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 5 tablespoonfuls of rice flour; the
whites of 4 eggs; 1 great spoonful of butter; 1 cup of
powdered sugar; a pinch of cinnamon, and same of nutmeg;
vanilla, or other extract; a little salt.</p>

<p>Scald the milk, and stir in the flour wet up to a thin
paste with cold milk. Cook until it begins to thicken;
add sugar and spice; simmer five minutes, stirring all the
while; pour out, and beat in the butter. Let it get cold;
flavor, and whip, a spoonful at a time, into the whisked
whites. Set to form in a wet mould. Prepare on Saturday.
Turn out on Sunday, and eat with sweet cream.
If more convenient, you can substitute corn-starch for
the rice flour.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sago Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Cut all the meat from your cold leg of lamb; crack the
bone to splinters; put on, with gristly bits of meat, skin,
etc., in three quarts of water, with an onion, and boil
slowly, at the back of the range, down to one quart.
Strain, cool, and skim. Add to what has been saved
from the mock-turtle stock made on Saturday. Heat,
and stir in half a cup of pearl sago, previously soaked
three hours in a very little water. Season, and simmer
half an hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lamb Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>The cold meat from yesterday’s joint; bread-crumbs;
1 tablespoonful of butter; 2 eggs; a little gravy; pepper,
salt, and a pinch of nutmeg.</p>

<p>Chop the cold lamb fine, season, and wet up with a
little good gravy. Mix in one-fourth as much crumbs as
you have meat; beat in the melted butter, the eggs, and
pour into a buttered mould. Set in a pan of hot water,
and cook, covered, in a good oven for one hour. Turn
out, and pour a little gravy over it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Corn.</span></h3>

<p>Green corn, even in city markets, is both indifferent
and dear at this season. We do better, therefore, to fall
back upon the invaluable canned vegetables that have
made American housewives almost independent of changing
seasons. Open a can of corn one hour before it is to
be cooked. When ready for it turn into a farina-kettle;
pour on just enough hot water to cover it, and cook half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
an hour. Then, add a little milk, a good lump of butter
cut up in flour, pepper and salt to taste, and cook fifteen
minutes longer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes au Naturel.</span></h3>

<p>Put over the fire in cold water; bring to a boil, and,
fifteen minutes thereafter, pour in a cup of cold water to
arrest the boil suddenly. After the beginning of the
second bubble, cook quite fast until a fork will enter the
largest potato without forcing. Turn off the water, set
the uncovered pot upon the fire for a minute; strip off
the skins quickly, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cabbage Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Shred a white cabbage fine; and pour over it a dressing
such as you made on Thursday, Second Week in
October, but without the chopped onion.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Grapes, Pears, and Bananas.</span></h3>

<p>Heap the grapes in one salver or basket, with a spray
of some climbing or clinging vine thrown around it.
Group pears and bananas together, and garnish with
autumn leaves.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tea à la Russe.</span></h3>

<p>Slice a fresh lemon; take off all the skin; lay the
slices, with powdered sugar strewed over them, in a plate,
pour out the tea, hot and strong, with plenty of sugar,
and pass the lemon with it. <i>Serve without cream.</i> I
shall never forget a surprise that was startling as well as
a disappointment, that came to me one day, when, sinking
under the depression of an incipient headache, brought
on by miles of picture galleries, I called for a cup of hot
tea in a foreign restaurant, and was served with what I
instantly pronounced to be “poison!” “<i>Molto buono</i>,”
protested the waiter, opening the tea-urn to show me a
whole lemon, skin and all, swimming upon the steaming
decoction of leaves. The combination of rind and the
cream with which I had “trimmed” my share of the too-fragrant

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soup and Bouilli.</span></h3>

<p>6 lbs. brisket of beef, all in one neat cut, with as little
bone as possible; 3 carrots; 1 small head of cauliflower
cut into clusters; 4 turnips; 6 <i>small</i> onions; bunch of
sweet herbs; 2 blades of mace; 1 tablespoonful of butter
cut up in flour; dice of fried bread; pepper, salt, and
French mustard.</p>

<p>Cover the meat well with water; bring to a very slow
boil, and continue this for four hours, skimming often and
filling up with boiling water as that in the pot sinks. At
the end of that time, put in the vegetables, cut into neat
squares. Season, and simmer about forty-five minutes, or
until the carrots are tender. Take up the meat; rub over
with butter and cover upon a heated dish. Strain the
soup from the vegetables without breaking them, and set
the colander in which they are left over boiling water
until after the soup is served. Strain this again through
a soup-sieve, and pour upon plenty of fried bread in the
tureen. If you like a thicker soup, return it after the
second straining, to the fire with a handful of tapioca, or
of German sago, ready-soaked, and simmer until clear.
When the soup is out of the way, arrange the vegetables
in little heaps around the beef, all of a kind together.
Put a cupful of the soup over the fire, stir in the floured
butter, mustard, pepper, and salt, to your liking; boil up
and pour over the beef.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Alice’s Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 5 eggs; 1 cup dry crumbs; ½ cup
strawberry, or other sweet jam; ½ cup of sugar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span></p>

<p>Butter a pudding-dish; strew crumbs on the bottom;
pour in the jam; cover this with the rest of the crumbs,
wet with milk. Heat the quart of milk to scalding; take
from the fire and pour upon the beaten yolks and sugar.
Then, whip in the frothed whites. Heat this three minutes,
and put upon the layer of crumbs in the dish,
spoonful by spoonful, letting each soak in well before
adding more. Bake in a steady oven until “set,” and
slightly colored. Eat cold with cream.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Poor Roger’s Soup.</span></h3>

<p>The bones of yesterday’s roast boiled down in 3 pints
of water to 1 pint; 1 pint of stock left from yesterday’s
soup; 6 parboiled potatoes sliced thin; ¼ cabbage sliced
small; 1 tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour; 1 sliced
and fried onion; 1 quart of hot water.</p>

<p>Parboil the cabbage; then put it on, with the potatoes
and fried onion, in the hot water; cook until the cabbage
is tender, and the potatoes broken to pieces. Take the
fat from the top of your stock; add the latter to the cabbage-soup;
season to taste; stir in the floured butter;
cook five minutes, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak and Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Flatten the steak with the broad side of a hatchet;
broil over clear coals; lay upon a chafing-dish, and pour
over it a little melted butter in which has been stewed a
quarter of an onion sliced. Strain out the onion; pepper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
and salt the butter; squeeze in the juice of half a
lemon. After it is poured over the steak, put a hot cover
over it, and let it stand five minutes before serving.
Steak thus treated has a delicious flavor.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Succotash.</span></h3>

<p>Put on in enough boiling water to cover it. Salt
slightly; stew half an hour; turn off most of the water,
and put in as much cold milk. Heat to boiling; stir in
a good lump of butter rolled in flour; pepper and salt;
simmer ten minutes, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Parisienne.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, and cut into small balls with your potato-gouge.
(The scraps should be boiled and mashed.) Boil in hot
salted water, until tender; drain, and drop into a saucepan
containing a cupful of drawn butter seasoned with
pepper and parsley. Stew three minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach.</span></h3>

<p>Pick off the leaves, and boil in plenty of hot salted
water. Drain; chop upon a board, or in a tray; put
into a saucepan, with a tablespoonful of butter, a little
sugar, pepper and salt, nutmeg, and a few spoonfuls of
milk or cream. Stir, and heat until bubbling hot; pour
out upon small squares of fried bread.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Apple Dumplings.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of prepared flour; 2 tablespoonfuls of lard, and
1 of butter; 1 saltspoonful of salt; 2 cups of milk.</p>

<p>Mix into a paste, rubbing shortening and salt into the
flour, then wetting with the milk. Roll out less than half
an inch thick; cut into squares; lay a pared and cored
apple in the centre of each; bring the corners together,
and join neatly. Lay in a buttered baking-pan, the
joined edges down, and bake to a nice brown. Glaze
with white of egg just before you take them up. Sift
powdered sugar over them, and eat with hot, sweet sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dieppe Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 lbs. of beef, cut from the shin, and sliced; 2 sliced
onions; 2 carrots; 1 teaspoonful of sugar; dripping for
frying; 3 stalks of celery; 5 quarts of water; ½ cup of
farina, soaked two hours in a little milk. Pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Flour, and fry the beef with the onion, sugar, pepper,
and salt, to a good brown in the dripping. Put into a
soup-pot, with five quarts of water, the carrots, and celery,
and cook slowly four hours, <i>at least</i>. Strain, cool,
and skim; season; add the farina, and simmer half an
hour longer, stirring faithfully.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Chickens.</span></h3>

<p>Truss and stuff the fowls as for roasting. Cover the
bottom of the pot with thin slices of salt pork or corned
ham; strew a little onion, a bunch of sweet herbs,
chopped, three blades of mace, a pinch of lemon-peel, a
little salt and pepper, upon this. Put in the chickens;
cover with weak broth—water will do, but is not so good—cover
closely and stew tender. The time will depend
upon the size and age of the chickens. When done, take
up and keep hot. Strain and skim the gravy; thicken
with browned flour, and pour over the fowls.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Beans.</span></h3>

<p>If you use dried beans, soak over night. Put on in
cold water, and cook slowly until soft. Drain, pepper,
salt, and butter; then dish hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Browned Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Work cold mashed potatoes soft with milk and butter;
season with pepper and salt. Make into round, flat
cakes; flour well, and bake brown in a quick oven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, slice, and stew twenty minutes. Season with
pepper, salt, sugar, a lump of butter rolled in flour; put
in a tablespoonful of fine bread-crumbs, and simmer ten
minutes longer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tapioca Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup tapioca, soaked six hours in a little cold water;
1 quart of milk; 1 large cup of sugar; 5 eggs; grated
peel of ½ lemon; a little salt.</p>

<p>Scald the milk, and pour upon the yolks and sugar;
beat the soaked tapioca into this custard; salt; whip in
the frothed whites. Pour into a buttered mould; put on
the top, and set in a pan of boiling water, and this into a
moderate oven. Cook three-quarters of an hour, or until
firm. Turn out carefully, and eat with sauce.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Clam Soup.</span></h3>

<p>50 clams; 1 quart of milk; 1 pint of water; 2 tablespoonfuls
of butter; 12 whole peppers; a few bits of cayenne-pods;
6 blades of mace; salt to taste; 1 tablespoonful
of corn-starch.</p>

<p>Cut the hard parts from the clams, and set by the soft
portions. Put the hard bits into the soup-pot, with the
clam-liquor, the water, and spices. Boil half an hour;
strain, salt, and return to the fire, with the soft parts.
When the soup begins to simmer, stir in the butter and
corn-starch. Stew five minutes, and pour into the tureen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
Stir in the boiling milk, and serve. Send oyster-crackers
and sliced lemon around with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Cod.</span></h3>

<p>Sew up the fish in a clean bit of mosquito-net, and cook
in boiling salted water, fifteen minutes to the pound. Unwrap,
and pour over it a few spoonfuls of sauce, putting
the rest into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>A cupful of the liquor in which your fish is cooking,
strained and skimmed. Put into a saucepan; heat, and
stir in a great spoonful of butter rolled in a teaspoonful
of flour. When this boils, add the pounded yolks of two
boiled eggs, and a tablespoonful of minced cucumber
pickle. Boil once, and serve. Garnish the fish with rings
of whites of eggs, and pickles, sliced.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Purée of Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>8 hard-boiled eggs; 3 raw eggs; 1 cup of gravy saved
from yesterday’s chickens; 1 tablespoonful of butter;
chopped parsley; pepper, salt, and nutmeg; some fine
crumbs; fried bread.</p>

<p>Pound the boiled yolks, and work in butter, parsley,
seasoning, and the raw eggs. Beat stiff, and rub through
a colander. Mince the whites until they are like coarse
snow, and stir over the fire in the hot gravy five minutes,
with a tablespoonful of crumbs. Make a mound of the
yolks in the middle of a stone-china dish; form a ring of the
whites around them, with an outer wall of triangles of fried
bread. Sift fine crumbs over all, and brown nicely upon
the upper grating of the oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare as usual, and send in with the fish-course.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower au Gratin.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, tied up in a net, in plenty of hot salted water,
forty minutes, if large. Put into a buttered bake-dish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
blossom upward; cover with drawn butter; sift fine
crumbs over it, and set in the oven ten minutes to color
the crumbs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coffee Custard Méringue.</span></h3>

<p>6 eggs—whites and yolks separated; 1 quart of milk;
1 cup of sugar; 1 cup of strong made coffee.</p>

<p>Whip the whites to a stiff froth with a little powdered
sugar. Heat the milk—with a pinch of soda in it; lay
the <i>méringue</i> upon it in great spoonfuls, turning when the
lower side is poached. Lift with a skimmer, as each
spoonful is done, and lay upon a sieve to cool and drain.
When all are out of the milk, pour it upon the beaten
yolks and sugar. Return to the farina-kettle, and stir
until it begins to thicken. Take from the fire, and stir in
the hot coffee. When all are cold put the <i>méringues</i> into
a glass bowl, and pour the custard over them. The <i>méringues</i>
will at once rise to the surface, coated with the
custard.</p>

——<br />
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Excellent Stock Soup.</span></h3>

<p>1 knuckle of veal, all the bones well cracked, and all
the meat, except what is taken off your collops; 4 pig’s
feet, cleaned and cracked; 3 lbs. of beef marrow-bones;
bunch of herbs; 3 onions; 3 carrots, sliced; 6 blades of
mace; 4 stalks of celery; 9 quarts of water; pepper and
salt; ½ cup of rice.</p>

<p>Put the meat, bones, and feet on in the water overnight,
cooking two hours before the fire goes down, and
leaving on the range in the pot (which must be scrupulously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
clean) all night, salting it a little. In the morning,
add the herbs and vegetables, and simmer gently six hours.
Take from the fire, and strain, picking out the meat and
bones, and rubbing the vegetables through the colander.
Put meat and bones into the stock-pot; salt and pepper
highly, and pour on them all the soup, except two quarts.
There should be at least six quarts of strong broth, the
extra waste in boiling having been made up by adding hot
water from time to time. Season the stock well, and put
away in a cold place. Cool and skim to-day’s soup, season,
and put over the fire with the rice. Simmer until
the rice is tender.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Collops with Tomato Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Cut three pounds of meat from your veal knuckle, and
this into pieces two inches long and one wide. Flatten
with the side of a hatchet; flour well, and fry in dripping,
with half of a sliced onion. Put a cup of your soup-stock
into a saucepan, season well, and lay in the collops.
Have ready a cup of tomato sauce, rubbed smooth through
a colander, and seasoned. When the collops have stewed
ten minutes in the broth, add a tablespoonful of the sauce,
and the same quantity, at intervals of five minutes, until
all is used up. Be careful to follow these directions implicitly.
When the sauce is all in, put in a tablespoonful
of butter rolled thickly in browned flour. Simmer five
minutes, and serve in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Croquettes à la Princesse.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups boiled rice; 2 eggs; ½ cup of milk; pepper
and salt; a boiled sweetbread, minced fine, or boiled
fowl-giblets, or any cold meat minced, and worked to a
paste with the pounded yolks of two boiled eggs, and well
seasoned with butter, salt, cayenne and a pinch of lemon;
lard for frying.</p>

<p>Mix beaten eggs and milk with salt into the hot rice,
and stir in a saucepan until stiff. Let it get cold; make
into thin round cakes; enclose a spoonful of the meat-paste
in the centre of each, and roll the rice-ball round.
Dip in beaten egg, then in cracker-dust, and fry carefully
in plenty of hot lard. Drain and serve hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>See Monday of this week.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, slice and cook soft in boiling water. Drain, mash,
and press in a hot colander; season with pepper, salt,
and butter, and smooth in a mound within a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lausanne Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 pint of milk; 3 eggs; 2 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch;
½ cup of sugar; 1 teaspoonful of vanilla or other essence;
sweet jam or jelly.</p>

<p>Heat the milk, and stir in the corn-starch wet up with
cold milk. Stir until thick. Take from the fire, and
beat in sugar and egg, with flavoring. Melt a tablespoonful
of butter in a square, shallow baking-pan; pour in the
pudding and bake half an hour. Take it up; spread,
while hot, with the sweetmeats; roll up closely, lay upon
a dish, and sift sugar over it. Cut in slices an inch and a
half wide.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">White Broth.</span></h3>

<p>Remove the fat from your jelly-stock. Take out
enough for to-day’s use; also, two of the pig’s feet. Cut
the best part of the meat from these into as neat squares
as you can contrive, and lay aside. Heat the stock, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
the addition of a cup of boiling water, and put, meantime,
two tablespoonfuls of butter into a clean saucepan.
When it heats, stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour. Stir
fast, and, to keep it from browning, put in, now and then,
a few spoonfuls of soup. Cook five minutes; add gradually
to the soup; put in the pieces of meat, with more
seasoning, if required; boil once, pour into the tureen,
and add a cup of boiling milk.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Lay in a dripping-pan, pour a cupful of boiling water
over it, and cook, basting often, <i>about</i> ten minutes per
pound. If there is much fat on it, cover these parts with
a paste of flour and water, until the meat is nearly done.
Ten minutes before taking it up, dredge with flour, then
baste once with butter. If you like made gravy with beef,
pour off the fat from the top; thicken with browned flour,
season and boil once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Yorkshire Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>10 tablespoonfuls prepared flour; 1 cup of cold water;
2 cups of milk; 3 eggs; salt.</p>

<p>Rub the flour smooth in the water and milk; salt, beat
in the yolks, and, just before putting into the oven, whip in
the beaten whites. Put two tablespoonfuls from the fat
“top” of your beef gravy into a square baking-pan;
pour in the batter, and put into the other oven until
“set.” Baste then, every few minutes, with the hot dripping
until it is of a rich brown. Cut in squares, and lay
about the meat. Some much prefer this Yorkshire Pudding
to that cooked with the meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Browned Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil with their skins on about twenty minutes. Peel
carefully. Pour off nearly all the fat from the top of the
beef-dripping. Lay the potatoes in the pan around the
meat, and baste when you baste the beef. Drain well in
a colander.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Parsnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil tender in hot, salted water; scrape, slice lengthwise
when they are nearly cold; flour all over, and fry in
salted lard or dripping. Drain well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 lb. mashed potato, rubbed through a colander; ½ lb.
butter, creamed with the sugar; 6 eggs—whites and yolks
beaten separately; 1 lemon, squeezed into the hot potato;
1 teaspoonful of nutmeg, and the same of mace; 2 cups
white sugar.</p>

<p>Beat the yolks into the creamed butter and sugar; add
the potato. Beat very hard, and whip in the whisked
whites, with the spice. Bake in open shells of paste on
Saturday. Send grated cheese around with it.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Heat the contents of your stock-pot to boiling, after
adding a pint of hot water. Cook a few minutes; strain
off as much broth as you want for to-day, and return the
rest to the jar when you have scalded it well. Put in
more pepper and salt, and put by for future soups.</p>

<p>Heat and season the soup left out for to-day; add a
handful of macaroni, broken short, and cooked twenty
minutes in hot, salted water. Simmer five minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Réchauffée of Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Trim your cold roast neatly. Make incisions at short
distances apart, and thrust strips of fat salt pork quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
through it. Set in a round, deep baking-pan. Sprinkle
with minced onion, and pour over it a pint of gravy—the
remains of that which accompanied the roast, mixed with
some from the stock-pot. Season the gravy well with
pepper, salt, minced herbs, and a suspicion of French
mustard. It should be cold, and the oven slow, for the
first hour—never fast. Cover <i>very</i> tightly; open the
dish at the end of one hour, and turn the meat, but pay it
no further attention until two hours have passed. Then
dish it; strain the gravy; thicken as much as you want
for your meat with browned flour; boil up, and pour over
the beef. The rest can be set by for other uses. If the
beef has been cooked slowly and steadily, it will be tender
and most savory.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes au Gratin.</span></h3>

<p>Boil and mash the potatoes; press firmly in a greased
bowl; turn out upon a shallow pie-plate, also greased;
wash all over with raw egg; sift fine crumbs upon it, and
brown in a quick oven. Slip to a hot, flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kidney Beans—Fricasseed.</span></h3>

<p>Soak all night. Next day, put on in cold water, at the
back of the range, and cook tender. When you turn your
beef, after an hour’s cooking, dip out half a cupful of the
gravy. Cool and skim it; add a little minced parsley
and onion, and, when your beans are soft, pour off nearly
all the water, and add this gravy. There should be just
enough to keep them from getting dry. Simmer ten minutes,
and dish without draining.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Grapes, Boiled Chestnuts, Apples.</span></h3>

<p>Arrange the grapes in a fruit-dish, ornamented with
leaves. Put on the chestnuts in warm (not hot) water,
slightly salted. Bring to a boil, and cook fast fifteen minutes.
Drain in a colander; stir a spoonful of butter into
the chestnuts, tossing in the colander until dry. Serve in
a deep dish, lined with a napkin.</p>

<p>Polish the apples, and lay a fruit-knife at each place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Beef-olives Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Chop a few slices of the twice-served cold beef very fine;
mix with one-third as much cold mashed potato, wet with
gravy; season well; bind with a beaten egg, and stir in a
greased saucepan until quite stiff. Let it get cold; make
into small olive-shaped balls; flour, and lay aside. Strain
off the liquid from your stock-pot; bring to a boil, adding
hot water or seasoning, as the case may require; boil, and
skim for five minutes, and drop in the beef-olives carefully.
Simmer one minute—fast boiling would break them—and
pour out. If you have any pickled olives in the house,
add a dozen to the soup when you put in the beef-balls.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Stew, with Dumplings.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of lean mutton, cut into short strips; ½ lb. of salt
pork, chopped; ½ onion, minced; chopped parsley and
thyme; 1 cup of milk; 1 tablespoonful of flour wet up
with the milk; pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Put on the mutton in enough cold water to cover it, and
cook very slowly one hour. Then add the pork, onion,
pepper, and herbs, and stew an hour longer. Make out
a little paste, in the proportion used for the apple dumplings
on Wednesday, Third Week in October; cut into
strips, and drop into the stew. Cook ten minutes; take
out meat and dumplings with a skimmer; lay upon a dish;
add milk and flour to the gravy; stir until thickened, and
pour over the contents of the dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Wash well; lay in a good oven, and bake until soft.
Wrap in a napkin, and dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Open the can an hour before cooking, and pour out.
Put into a saucepan with a little minced onion, and stew
twenty minutes. Season with sugar, pepper, salt, and a
good piece of butter rolled in flour, and cook ten minutes
more.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beets Sautés.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, cut off the tops, and boil more than an hour.
Scrape, cut into round slices, and put into a saucepan with
two tablespoonfuls of butter, one of vinegar, and pepper
and salt to taste. Heat, toss, and stir ten minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Omelette Méringue.</span></h3>

<p>8 eggs; juice of a lemon, and half the grated peel; 4
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; a little sweet jam or
jelly; a pinch of salt; butter.</p>

<p>Beat eight yolks and four whites light; add salt, lemon-juice,
and a tablespoonful of powdered sugar. Put a
tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan, and when it heats,
run it all over the bottom. Pour in the omelette, shaking
and loosening from the sides with a spatula. So soon as
it is done at the edges sufficiently to be folded, lay a great
spoonful of jam or jelly upon it; fold over, and turn out
upon a stone-china dish. The <i>méringue</i>, made of the
remaining whites and sugar, should be ready—beaten with
the lemon-peel. Heap upon the omelette, and set upon
the upper grating of the oven to “set” and brown.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Barley Cream Soup.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. lean veal; 1 onion; ½ lb. pearl barley; 4 quarts
of water; salt, pepper, and a cup of milk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span></p>

<p>Cut the veal and onion very small; put on with the
barley. Boil slowly until reduced to two quarts. Strain,
rubbing the barley through a sieve. Season with pepper
and salt; simmer three minutes. It should be white and
thick as cream, when you have added the cup of boiling
milk, after which it must not boil.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Soak a ham four or five hours. Scrub it well, and put
on to boil in plenty of cold water. Cook eighteen or twenty
minutes to the pound. When done, leave in the water one
hour in the open air, or where it will cool rapidly. Take
off the skin carefully; rub all over with flour; sift fine
crumbs over the top and sides, and set ten minutes in a
quick oven. Wind frilled paper about the shank, and
where the paper joins the body of the ham, twine a wreath
of parsley.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chopped Cabbage.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off stalks and green leaves, and quarter a cabbage.
Boil fifteen minutes in hot salted water; pour this off, and
cover the cabbage with pot-liquor, taken from the ham-kettle,
and the fat skimmed off. Cook tender; drain,
pressing hard; chop, and again drain; season with pepper,
salt, and a little vinegar, and dish very hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Drain a can of corn. Chop the grains fine with a chopping-knife.
Add a cup of milk, three eggs, a tablespoonful
of melted butter, pepper and salt to taste. Beat all
together, and bake, covered, forty-five minutes, in a good
oven; then brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beet-root Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Chop the cold beets left from yesterday into rather
coarse dice. Mix with an equal quantity of cold chopped
potatoes, and pour over them such a dressing as was used
for Bavarian Salad, Thursday, Second Week in October.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Drunken Dominie.</span></h3>

<p>1 long or square stale sponge-cake; ¼ lb. of citron; 1
glass of brandy; 1 cup of sherry wine; 1 pint of milk; 3
eggs; ½ cup of sugar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span></p>

<p>Cut the citron into strips, and stick in regular rows in
the top of the cake. Six hours before you will want to
use it, pour over it, a little at a time, the liquor. It
should absorb it all, and hold it with Dutch perseverance.
Heat the milk; pour upon the beaten yolks and sugar.
Stir and cook until it thickens. When cold, pour around
the cake, as it lies upon a long dish, and cover the dominie
and his bed with a <i>méringue</i> of the whites, beaten up
with a little sugar. The citron spikes should be just visible
through the snowy blanket.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Western Soup.</span></h3>

<p>1 sheep’s head, cleaned, with the skin on; 4 cleaned
pig’s feet; 2 onions; 2 carrots; 2 turnips; bunch of
sweet herbs; 6 quarts of water; 12 whole peppers; salt
to taste.</p>

<p>Put the head and feet into the soup-pot, and pour over
them the water. When they have boiled slowly two
hours, and been often skimmed, put in the sliced vegetables
and herbs, and cook three hours longer, replenishing
with boiling water as the liquid sinks. There should be
five quarts of soup. Strain; lay aside the sheep’s tongue
to cool, with the meat from one of the feet. Season the
rest of the meat and bones; put into the stock-pot; pour
over it all the soup not needed for to-day, also the
skimmed pot-liquor from your ham, if it was corned—not
smoked. Season, and set in a cold place. Cool and skim
the soup meant for to-day; season, and put in the sliced
tongue and dice of pig’s feet. Boil one minute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Chickens and Cresses.</span></h3>

<p>Roast as directed on Thursday, First Week in October,
and lay a thick border of fresh water-cresses around them
on the dish, with a bunch under—or over—each wing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Polenta.</span></h3>

<p>1 pint of boiling water; 1 cup of coarse yellow meal,
or enough for thick mush; a little salt.</p>

<p>Put the water over the fire; add the salted meal, and
stir constantly until it has cooked twenty minutes, and
bubbles up in the middle. Turn upon a flat dish, and,
when cold and stiff, cut into squares; dip these into flour,
and fry to a yellow-brown. Drain off the fat. This is a
favorite dish with the Italian peasantry, who generally,
however, eat it without frying.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Salsify.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape; clean, without cutting the roots; drop into
cold water as you clean them. Put on in boiling water,
a little salt; when tender, take out a cupful of the water,
thicken with two tablespoonfuls of butter rolled thickly in
flour; boil up and pepper. Dish the salsify, pour the
sauce over it, and cover over hot water five minutes, to
let it soak in.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare as usual.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apricot Trifle.</span></h3>

<p>1 can of California apricots; 1 quart of milk; 4 eggs;
1 cup of sugar; ½ package of Cooper’s gelatine; 2 tablespoonfuls—even
ones—of corn-starch, wet up with milk.</p>

<p>Sweeten the apricots with half the sugar, and set aside
in a bowl. Heat the milk; stir in the corn-starch; pour
over the beaten eggs and sugar. Cook until it begins to
thicken, and pour hot upon the gelatine, which should
have been soaked in a little cold water, and then dissolved
in a very little hot milk. Beat all up well, and let them
get cold. Wet a mould; put in a cupful of the custard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
cover with apricots, drained from the syrup; wait fifteen
minutes, and pour on more cream; in a few minutes,
more apricots, and so on until all are used up. Set in
ice to form, and, when firm, turn out, and pour the apricot-syrup
over the trifle. If the apricots are large, you
would do well to cut them up.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Peas Porridge.</span></h3>

<p>Soak a quart of split peas overnight. Next morning
put them on to boil in enough cold water to cover them
well. When this has fairly begun to boil, pour it off, and
add stock from your store in the stock-jar. Cook slowly,
taking care it does not burn, until the peas are very soft.
Rub through a colander and serve. Save a pint as a
foundation for to-morrow’s soup—more than a pint, if you
can. Never forget that soup makes soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Pickerel.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and wash the fish. Wipe carefully inside and
out. Dredge with flour all over the outside, and fry to a
nice brown—<i>never</i> to a crisp—in lard or dripping. Drain
off the fat; lay upon a hot dish—the head of one fish to
the tail of the other—and garnish with curled parsley and
quartered lemon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p>Chop the meat from your roast chickens, and mix with
one-third as much mashed potato. Season; moisten wel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>l
with a gravy made by boiling down the bones and stuffing
in water, then straining and seasoning it. Beat into the
mixture one or two whipped eggs; heat and stir over the
fire until quite stiff. Turn out and cool; then roll into
croquettes, dip in egg and pounded cracker, and fry to a
golden brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Purée of Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash the potatoes with butter and milk, working them
smooth and soft. Season, put over the fire and stir until
almost stiff. Mound upon a flat dish, and strain over
them a little of yesterday’s gravy, skimmed and heated.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, quarter, boil, and mash the squash. Season with
pepper, salt, butter, and whip in two beaten eggs. When
you have a light cream, turn into a buttered pudding-dish,
and bake in a quick oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>About 10 fine apples, pared, cored, and sliced half an
inch thick; juice of 1 lemon; sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg;
3 cups of prepared flour; nearly 4 cups of milk; 5
eggs; a little salt.</p>

<p>Spread the slices of apple upon a dish, and sprinkle
with lemon-juice and sugar. Beat the yolks light; add
milk, then the whisked whites and salted flour by turns.
Dip the slices of apple into the batter, turning over and
over until thoroughly coated, and fry in hot lard, a few at
a time. Drain upon a hot sieve, and sift powdered sugar,
cinnamon, and nutmeg upon them. Eat with wine sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato and Pea Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Empty a can of tomatoes. Put them over the fire with
three pints of stock and stew one hour. Strain, rubbing
the pulp through the colander; add what was left yesterday
of the pea porridge; season to taste, simmer fifteen
minutes, and pour upon dice of fried bread into the
tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Calf’s Liver and Bacon.</span></h3>

<p>Wash a fresh liver well, and, when quite ready to cook
it, cut into long, narrow slices. Dip each in flour highly
seasoned with pepper and salt. Melt a tablespoonful of
good dripping in a saucepan; lay in the liver, the slices
fitting neatly to one another; strew with sliced onion, and
cover entirely with very thin slices of fat salt pork, or
bacon. Fit a close top on the saucepan; cook <i>very</i>
slowly, never allowing it to bubble, for one hour. The
liver should be steamed, not stewed, much less fried.
When very tender, take it out and lay upon a dish. Add
a tablespoonful of tomato sauce to the gravy, thicken with
browned flour wet with water; boil once, and pour over
the liver.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Parsnip Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape, and boil in hot salted water until tender. Mash
them very smooth, picking out all the fibres. Add to four
large parsnips one beaten egg, a teaspoonful of prepared
flour, with pepper and salt, and a teaspoonful of milk.
Make into cakes; flour, and fry in dripping. Drain well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>See Sunday, Third Week in October.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bread-and-Raisin Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; loaf of stale baker’s bread, the crust
all pared off, and cut into slices half an inch thick; butter
to spread the bread; 4 eggs; ½ cup of sugar; ½ lb. of
raisins, seeded and cut into thirds.</p>

<p>Make a raw custard of eggs, sugar, and milk. Fit slices
of buttered bread into the bottom of a buttered bake-dish.
Pour on custard, and strew with raisins. Lay in more
buttered slices, and so on, until the dish is full. The last
layer should be well-soaked bread. Cover closely; set
in a baking-pan of hot water, and bake an hour and a
quarter. Turn out; pour hot, sweet sauce over it, and
send more around with it.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Soup.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of beef; 2 lbs. of veal; ½ lb. of lean ham; 1
onion; 2 carrots; 2 tablespoonfuls of farina; 1 can of
corn, drained and chopped; 2 stalks of celery; pepper
and salt; 6 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Cut the meat into long strips, the vegetables into dice,
and pack, in alternate layers, in a broad, low jar, that will
go into the oven. Strew the layers with farina and corn,
fill up with the water; cover the jar closely, putting a
paste of flour and water over the top or about the edges,
to exclude the air and keep in the steam. Do this on
Saturday night. At bed-time, set in the oven in a pan of
cold water, that it may heat gradually as the range warms
in the morning. Let it bake until dinner-time. Pour
into a bowl, take out the meat, season, and put it into the
stock-pot. Pour over it as much as you can spare of the
soup, season, and set by for to-morrow. Add pepper and
salt to that left for to-day, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fillet of Veal.</span></h3>

<p>Take out the bone of the joint (you can add it on Saturday
to your baked soup); make a deep incision between
the meat and the “flap,” which your butcher will skewer
around the fillet. Fill this and the hole left by taking
out the bone with a force-meat of crumbs, chopped salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
pork, chopped thyme and parsley, grated lemon-peel, pepper,
salt, and the juice of a lemon. Bind the fillet into
shape with tapes; cover the top with a paste of flour and
water, and bake twelve minutes to the pound, putting a
cup of boiling water into the pan. When done, pull off
the paste; dredge with flour, and baste well with butter.
The meat should have been very freely basted while cooking.
Dish the meat when browned; season, and thicken
the gravy; boil up, and pour into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cannelon of Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash the potatoes thoroughly; beat light with butter,
milk, and two raw eggs. Heat in a greased frying pan,
stirring constantly, until stiff enough to handle. Make
into a long roll; brush over with beaten eggs, and sift
crumbs over it. Lay in a buttered baking-pan, and brown
nicely in a quick oven. Dish, and pour over it a cup of
good drawn butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">French Beans à la Crême.</span></h3>

<p>Open a can of string-beans; clip them into short pieces,
and cook twenty minutes in hot salted water. Drain.
Have ready, in a saucepan, two tablespoonfuls of cream,
and as much butter, heated together; pour upon a beaten
egg; return to the saucepan; season with pepper and
salt; stir in a tablespoonful of hot vinegar; take from the
fire; dish the beans, and pour the sauce over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Stew the contents of a can of tomatoes twenty minutes.
Strain and pulp through a colander. Add butter, rolled
in flour; a little sugar; salt and pepper; cook ten minutes
and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Neapolitainoes.</span></h3>

<p>Make enough puff-paste for a pie; roll out into a sheet
half an inch thick, and cut into strips three inches long
and half as wide. Bake in a quick oven. When cold,
spread half of them with sweet jam or jelly, and stick the
others over them in pairs—the jelly being, of course, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
the middle. Ice with a frosting made of the whites of two
eggs, whipped stiff with half a pound of sugar.</p>

<p>Make these on Saturday. Pass with them strong, hot
coffee, with a great spoonful of whipped cream on the
surface of each cupful.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sago Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Strain off two quarts of soup from your stock-pot, when
you have removed the cake of fat from the top; heat,
and stir into it half a cup of German sago previously
soaked in a little cold water. Simmer until the sago is
dissolved.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal and Oyster Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the best parts of your cold roast fillet into thin
dominoes. Put a layer in the bottom of a pudding-dish;
sprinkle with the dressing, chopped fine, or with minced
ham; cover with oysters; strew these with pepper, salt,
butter-bits, a pinch of grated lemon-peel, and squeeze a
few drops of lemon-juice over them. More veal, etc.,
and, when the dish is full, pour in yesterday’s gravy,
skimmed, and mixed with as much oyster-liquor. Cover
with a good paste, and bake one hour. Wash over with
white of egg just before you take it up. The pastry can,
in cold weather, be made on Saturday, and kept in a cool
place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Put on in cold water and bring to a boil. At the end
of twenty minutes throw in a cup of cold water to arrest
the boil. Heat up again quickly, and when a fork will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
pierce the large potatoes easily, pour off the water. Put
in a little salt, and set the uncovered pot upon the range
for one minute. Take each potato in a towel, and hold
in your hand while you strip off the peel. The fashion
of sticking a fork through them, in order to pare them,
breaks and cools them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Slaw.</span></h3>

<p>Shred a white cabbage and pour over it the following</p>


<h3><i>Dressing.</i></h3>

<p>2 beaten eggs; 2 teaspoonfuls of sugar; 6 tablespoonfuls
of vinegar; ½ teaspoonful of made mustard and same
of pepper and salt; ½ teaspoonful of celery essence; 1
tablespoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Mix well, stir over the fire until scalding hot. When
cold, add to the cabbage. Toss and stir, and set in a
cold place until wanted.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Celery.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape and cut the blanched stalks into short pieces.
Cook tender in boiling water, a little salt. Drain this off,
add a cup of drawn butter; simmer five minutes, and
serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dessert of Fruit and Nuts.</span></h3>

<p>Arrange in accordance with your taste and convenience.
You may add dried figs to the dish of nuts.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Strong Broth.</span></h3>

<p>Heat the contents of your stock-pot, adding a quart or
more of boiling water. Let all simmer together one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
hour. Strain and press out the nourishment from the
meat. Cool; skim, add seasoning, and half a cup of
soaked rice. Cook gently until this is soft.</p>

<p>N. B.—Whenever the stock-pot is empty, scald it with
soda and water, and set in the sun.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak.</span></h3>

<p>Flatten a steak; broil upon a greased gridiron over a
clear fire. Lay upon a hot dish; pepper and salt; lay
bits of butter over it, and cover three or four times before
sending to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Omelette, with Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Beat seven eggs just enough to break up the yolks.
Put a piece of butter as large as an egg in the frying-pan,
and, when it heats, pour in the eggs. Loosen from the
sides and bottom of the pan, from the first, by shaking the
pan, and using your cake-turner. When “set” in the
middle, cover one half with hot stewed tomatoes; fold
over the other half so as to enclose it, and invert the pan
upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Whip up soft with butter, milk, and salt, and heap
roughly upon a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Puffs.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup of prepared flour; ½ cup of powdered sugar; 1
tablespoonful of butter; 3 beaten eggs; juice and grated
peel of half a lemon; 3 tablespoonfuls of milk, with a <i>tiny</i>
pinch of soda.</p>

<p>Rub butter and sugar together; beat in the yolks, the
milk, whites, flour; at last, and quickly, the lemon.
Bake in buttered corn-bread pans, or in paté-pans. The
oven should be quick. Turn out, and eat hot with sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Tea, with Noodles.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of lean beef; 2 onions; 2 turnips; 2 carrots; 2
cloves; 2 quarts and 1 pint of water; a good handful of
noodles (made according to receipt given on Wednesday,
First Week in August).</p>

<p>Mince the vegetables. Put on in the water, and boil
down to two quarts. Drain off, and pour upon the beef,
minced <i>very</i> fine. Simmer one hour; strain, season, and
put in the noodles. Cook gently twenty minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Smothered Chickens.</span></h3>

<p>Split a pair of tender chickens down the back, as for
broiling. Lay in a dripping-pan; pour over them a cup
of boiling water, in which has been dissolved a great
spoonful of butter. Invert another pan over this one, to
keep in the steam, and cook, basting often, until the
chickens are russet-colored all over, and very tender.
Baste twice with butter at the last. Dish the chickens;
thicken, season, and boil up; then pour part over the
chickens, the rest into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salsify Sauté.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape and cut the salsify-roots into pieces two inches
long; cook tender in boiling water, slightly salt. Shake
and drain in a colander, to get rid of all the water. Have
in a frying- or saucepan two or three spoonfuls of butter,
with a little pepper. When hot, put in the salsify. Heat
and toss five minutes, but do not let it brown. Serve
very hot. It is exceedingly nice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni au Gratin.</span></h3>

<p>Break half a pound of macaroni into inch lengths.
Make a weak broth by diluting the remains of yesterday’s
soup with hot water, and straining it. When it boils, season
well, and put in the macaroni. Cook until tender,
but not broken. Drain off the liquor; put the hot macaroni
upon a stone-china dish; stir a good piece of butter
through it; sift over it a mixture of grated cheese and fine
bread-crumbs. Set upon the upper grating of the oven to
brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brussels Sprouts.</span></h3>

<p>Cook about twenty-five minutes in boiling salt water.
Drain; season with pepper, salt, and butter; stir these in
well, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">English Tapioca Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup of tapioca, soaked two hours in a pint of the
milk; 3 pints of milk; 5 eggs; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter;
1 cup of sugar; ½ lb. raisins, seeded, and cut in half;
grated peel of half a lemon.</p>

<p>Put the soaked tapioca in a farina-kettle, and surround
with lukewarm water. Bring to a boil, and, when soft all
through, add the creamed butter and sugar; then the
eggs; next, the tapioca; finally, the fruit. Bake one
hour in a buttered dish. Eat hot, with sauce.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton Soup.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. scrag of mutton—bones cracked and meat
chopped; 2 turnips; 2 onions; chopped parsley; pepper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
and salt; 3 quarts of water; ½ cup of barley, soaked two
hours in a little water.</p>

<p>Put on meat and vegetables with the bones in the
water, and simmer three hours and a half. There should
be two quarts of soup. Strain, cool, and season; add the
barley, and cook gently until this is soft.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Rabbits.</span></h3>

<p>Skin, clean with great care, and wash a pair of fat rabbits—or
hares—stuff with a force-meat of crumbs and
chopped fat salt pork, seasoned with onion, thyme, pepper
and salt. Sew up with fine thread; bind the legs to the
body in a kneeling posture, and lay in the dripping-pan.
Pour over them a cupful of boiling water, and cover as
you did the chickens yesterday. Baste with butter twice,
with their own gravy twice, and twice, at last, with butter.
Just before you take them up, dredge with flour and give
a final baste with butter. Dish when you have clipped
and drawn out the threads. Thicken and season the
gravy, and pour into a gravy-boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Custards.</span></h3>

<p>6 tablespoonfuls of finely grated cheese; 2 tablespoonfuls
of butter; 4 eggs; 1 cup of milk, with a teaspoonful
of corn-starch stirred in it; salt and pepper; soda.</p>

<p>Beat the eggs very light, and pour upon them the milk
heated (with a pinch of soda) and thickened with the corn-starch.
While still warm, add pepper, salt, butter, and
cheese. Beat up well and pour into greased custard-cups.
Bake in a quick oven about fifteen minutes, or until high
and brown. Serve at once, as a separate course, passing
bread and butter with them. They should follow the soup
directly, or be served just before the dessert.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Corn.</span></h3>

<p>Empty a can of corn into a saucepan and cover with
hot-salted water. Cook half an hour, drain off the water,
add a cup of milk, and, when this boils, a tablespoonful of
butter rolled in flour. Pepper and salt to taste; simmer
five minutes and serve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Soak the dried beans overnight, changing the water
twice. In the morning put on to cook in cold water,
with a clean piece of streaked fat pork or bacon, an inch
or so square. When the beans are soft, drain; take out
the pork and dish; seasoning with butter, pepper and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cocoa Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup of fine crumbs; 1 quart of milk; 4 eggs; 2 tablespoonfuls
of butter; 1 scant cup of sugar; 2 tablespoonfuls
of grated cocoa, or of cocoatina; 1 teaspoonful of Colgate’s
vanilla.</p>

<p>Soak the bread in the milk; put over the fire in a farina-kettle,
and stir to a boil. When thick and smooth, stir
in the butter, the sugar, and the cocoa. Take from the
fire, pour out; beat two minutes and whip in the beaten
yolks, then the whites, which should have been beaten
stiff. Put into a buttered mould, set in a pan of hot water
and bake forty-five minutes in a moderate oven. Turn
out and eat with powdered sugar.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Milk Soup.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk and the same of water; 2 onions; 2
turnips; 2 stalks of celery; 1 teaspoonful of sugar—a
pinch of soda in the milk; 2 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch
wet up in cold water; pepper and salt; dice of fried
bread; two tablespoonfuls of butter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span></p>

<p>Boil chopped onions, turnips and celery in the water
until soft enough to be pulped through the colander. Do
this, season, add the water in which they were cooked,
the milk, and when the soup boils, the corn-starch. At
last, stir in the butter a little at a time, to prevent oiling.
Simmer five minutes, and pour upon the fried bread in the
tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ragoût of Duck.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and wash a duck; put into the dripping-pan,
with a large cupful of boiling water, and roast, basting
often, half an hour. Meanwhile, boil the giblets in a
pint of water. Take up the duck and joint as for fricassee.
Put into a saucepan with the gravy from the dripping-pan
and the water in which the giblets were boiled;
add an onion stuck with cloves; a little salt and pepper.
Cover and stew gently an hour and a half. Take up the
duck and keep hot upon a chafing-dish. Strain the gravy;
stir in a tablespoonful of butter rubbed in one of browned
flour, the juice of a lemon, and a glass of wine. Boil up
and pour over the duck.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Turn the peas into a saucepan; cover with boiling
water, and cook twenty-five minutes. Drain well; add
pepper, salt and butter, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare as on Tuesday of this Week.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Celery Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape and cut the best stalks into short lengths. Put
into a salad-bowl, and season with a dressing of two tablespoonfuls
of oil to five of vinegar, one teaspoonful of
sugar, and a saltspoonful, each, of salt and pepper.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sponge Gingerbread and Chocolate.</span></h3>

<p>5 cups of flour; 1 heaping tablespoonful of butter; 1
cup of molasses; 1 cup of sugar; 1 cup of sour milk;
2 tablespoonfuls of saleratus, dissolved in hot water; 2
teaspoonfuls of ginger; 1 teaspoonful of cinnamon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span></p>

<p>Mix molasses, sugar, butter, and spice together. Warm
slightly, and beat five minutes. Add milk, saleratus,
lastly the flour. Beat hard five minutes, and bake in a
broad, shallow pan; or in small tins. Eat warm with a
cup of good chocolate, made by stirring six tablespoonfuls
of chocolate, wet with cold water, into a pint of boiling
water, boiling twenty minutes, adding the milk, and cooking
ten minutes longer, stirring often.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Family Soup.</span></h3>

<p>4 lbs. of lean beef; 2 lbs. of cracked bones, of any kind;
4 turnips; 3 carrots; 2 onions; 4 stalks of celery; 7
quarts of water; pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Cut the meat into strips, and fry with a sliced onion,
in dripping, until brown, but not dry. Slice the carrots,
turnips, and onion; chop the celery, and put these with
meat, fried onion, bones, and gravy from the frying-pan,
into the soup-pot. Add the water, and cook slowly four
hours after the boil begins. Pour off the liquor—there
should be at least five quarts; take out meat and bones,
season highly, and consign to the stock-pot, with all of
the liquor except that needed for to-day. Salt and pepper,
and set away in a cold place. Pulp the vegetables
into the soup kept out for to-day; cool, skim, season, and
bring to a gentle boil; then pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Killarney Stew.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of lean mutton—that from the scrag is best, and
you can use the bones for your soup; 8 sliced potatoes;
1 sliced onion; salt, pepper, and chopped parsley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span></p>

<p>Put on the mutton, cut into small pieces, with the sliced
onion, and enough cold water to cover it, and stew very
slowly two hours, or until tender. Strain the gravy into a
bowl, and set in cold water to throw up the fat. Put a
layer of potatoes, sliced thin, in the bottom of a saucepan;
cover with meat, peppered and salted; sprinkle with
parsley—more potatoes, and more meat until all are in.
Take all the fat from the top of the gravy and strain it
over the meat. Cover closely, and simmer until the
potatoes are broken to pieces. Half an hour after the
boil begins should suffice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Drain the superfluous juice from a can of tomatoes
into your boiling soup. Lay the tomatoes in a buttered
pie-dish; season with pepper, salt, butter and sugar; strew
bread-crumbs over the top; add a little gravy saved from
yesterday’s ragoût; cover, and bake half an hour; then
brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, and, when cold, scrape off the skins; slice lengthwise,
and fry to a light brown in nice dripping, or butter.
Drain, salt, pepper, and serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Carrots.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape, and boil whole forty-five minutes. Drain, and
cut into round slices a quarter of an inch thick. Put on
in a cupful of weak broth—a little of your soup will do—and
cook gently half an hour. Then add three or four
tablespoonfuls of milk, a lump of butter rolled in flour,
with seasoning to taste. Boil up and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>3 cupfuls of flour; 2 cupfuls of sour milk; 1 teaspoonful
of soda dissolved in hot water; ½ cupful powdered
suet; a little salt.</p>

<p>Stir the milk gradually into the flour until a smooth
batter is the result. Put in suet and salt; lastly, beat in
the soda-water thoroughly and quickly. Pour into a buttered
mould and boil one hour and a half. Turn out and
eat hot with sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tapioca Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the top of your stock-pot, dip out as
much as you need for to-day; add a large cupful of boiling
water and strain into the soup-kettle. Bring to a boil,
skim, and put in half a cup of grained tapioca, which has
been soaked for two hours in a little water. Simmer until
clear.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Saddle of Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Lay in the dripping-pan, pour a large cup of boiling
water over it, and roast twelve minutes to the pound,
basting often. As it begins to brown, cover with white
paper, lifting this when you baste the meat. Ten minutes
before serving, take off the paper, dredge the mutton with
flour; baste with butter, and brown. Skim the fat from
the gravy; thicken with browned flour, season, and boil
once, then serve in a boat. Pass currant jelly with the
mutton.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Puff.</span></h3>

<p>Whip boiled potatoes light with a fork; beat in butter,
salt, and milk, at last, two frothed eggs. Whisk to a cream;
make into a smooth mound in a greased bake-dish, and
set in a quick oven to brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salsify Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>1 bunch of salsify; 2 beaten eggs; ½ cup of milk;
flour for thin batter; salt.</p>

<p>Wash, scrape, and grate the salsify into the batter, made
of the ingredients given above. It should be as thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
when the salsify is in, as pound-cake batter. Drop by
the spoonful into hot fat. Fry quickly, drain in a hot
colander, and serve dry and hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kidney Beans à l’Anglaise.</span></h3>

<p>Soak dried white beans all night in cold water. Exchange
in the morning for tepid, and finally put on to
boil in cold. Heat and cook slowly, and when, after two
hours, the skin begins to crack, strain off the water, adding
it to your soup-stock if you like, after salting it sufficiently
to warrant its keeping. Put a folded towel upon
the beans left in the saucepan, and set at the side of the
range, where they will keep hot, without scorching, for
half an hour. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; stir in a
small bit of butter, and dish. Beans thus cooked will be
very mealy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Almond Blanc-Mange.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 1 package Cooper’s gelatine, soaked
one hour in a little cold water; 3 oz. of almonds,
blanched, dried, and pounded in a mortar, with a little
rose-water to prevent oiling; ¾ cup of sugar; extract bitter
almonds.</p>

<p>Heat the milk to scalding; add the gelatine, the
pounded almonds, and, when you have stirred these over
the fire ten minutes, the sugar. Strain through thin
muslin, wringing and squeezing to get out the flavor of
the almonds. Flavor, and set in a wet mould to form.
Do this on Saturday. On Sunday, turn it out, and eat
with powdered sugar and cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Rose Cake.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Irish Broth.</span></h3>

<p>Strain off as much soup from the stock-pot as you
need for to-day. Heat and skim; stir in a large cupful
of mashed potato, rubbed through a colander; season to
taste; simmer ten minutes, and add a great spoonful of
butter rolled in flour. Boil up fairly, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cotelettes à la Reine.</span></h3>

<p>Cut thick slices of the most nearly underdone portions
of your roast mutton. Divide into neat squares about
three inches across; dip each in thick drawn butter, in
which the yolks of two eggs have been cooked. Lay the
cutlets to cool upon a broad dish. When the creamy
coating is cold and firm, roll each in pounded cracker,
and fry—a few at a time—in hot lard or dripping. As
each is lightly browned, take up with a skimmer, and
drain off the fat. Arrange in a dish, overlapping one
another.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare; cut into dice; throw into cold water, and leave
there half an hour. Put on to cook in boiling salted
water; stew twenty minutes. Drain off most of the water,
and fill up with cold milk. When this boils, stir in a lump
of butter rolled in flour, with chopped parsley. Cook
gently five minutes longer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Savory Bread Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Soak two cups of bread-crumbs in a cupful of yesterday’s
gravy, diluted with a little of your soup-stock. Add
a cup of boiling milk, in which a pinch of soda has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span>
stirred; beat to a smooth batter; add half a cupful of
minced cold meat, three eggs, pepper, and salt. Pour
into a buttered bake-dish, after beating all up light, and
bake in a quick oven. Serve in the dish, and pass a little
good gravy, or drawn butter, with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bean Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Put cold beans left from yesterday into a salad-bowl,
and pour over it such a dressing as you prepared for Cold
Slaw, on Monday, First Week in November.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Apples, Cream, and Cake.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and core juicy pippins. Put a cupful of water,
and one of sugar, into a bake-dish. Lay in the pippins;
cover, and cook slowly until clear and tender. They
should be turned once while cooking. Set away, still
covered, in the bake-dish, to cool, on Saturday. On
Monday, put them into a glass dish, and send cream and
cake to table with them.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton and Oyster Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Crack the bone of your cold mutton, and chop the
refuse bits left from the roast. Put on in two quarts of
water, and boil down to one. Strain, cool, skim, and add
to it a quart of stock. If no liquor is left in the stock-pot
for this purpose, add two quarts of water to the meat,
bones, etc., in the bottom, and boil down to one; then
strain. Heat the two quarts of broth to boiling; add two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
dozen oysters, with their liquor; season with pepper, salt,
and a little mace. Boil one minute. Stir in a great
spoonful of butter rubbed in flour; simmer, and stir two
minutes, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak au Maître d’Hôtel.</span></h3>

<p>Treat as directed on Tuesday of First Week in November;
but, when laid upon the hot dish, put over it, and on
both sides, two or three tablespoonfuls of butter, in which
have been mixed pepper, salt, a little French mustard,
and the juice of half a lemon, with a teaspoonful of very
finely minced parsley.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, and bake in a moderate oven until soft. Serve
in their skins.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Top, tail, and skin. Boil in two waters, throwing both
away. When the onions are tender, have ready in a
saucepan a cup of drawn butter. Lay the onions in it;
simmer ten minutes, and serve in the sauce.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, quarter, and cook soft in boiling salt water.
Strain, press, and mash in a colander. Season with pepper,
salt, and butter, and turn into a deep dish.</p>

<p>2 cups of milk; 4 tablespoonfuls of sugar; 1 heaping
cup of prepared flour; yolks of 4 eggs, and whites of
two; pulp of 2 oranges, chopped very fine; grated peel
of ½ an orange; 1 tablespoonful of melted butter.</p>

<p>Cream butter and sugar, and whip in the yolks, then
the yellow pulp and the grated peel of the oranges. Beat
three minutes; add the milk, then flour and whites, alternately.
Pour into a buttered mould, and boil one hour.
Eat hot, with jelly sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Barley Cream Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 lbs. of veal—cut from the knuckle; 1 cupful of barley;
3 quarts of water; salt and pepper; chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Put the meat, cut into strips, into a pot with the water
and barley, and cook slowly four hours. Pick out the
meat, having strained off the liquor into a bowl; then rub
the barley through a soup-sieve. Season with pepper,
salt, and parsley; boil up once, and serve. It should be
of a creamy consistency.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Chine of Pork.</span></h3>

<p>Boil half an hour in hot salted water. Take out and
lay upon a dish to cool somewhat. (Put the pot liquor into
the stock-pot.) Rub the warm chine all over with a little
pepper and powdered sage; then, with beaten egg; strew
with bread-crumbs, and set in a good oven until tender.
Should it brown too fast, cover it. Pass apple sauce with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peas Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>4 cups of split peas; 1 tablespoonful of butter; 3 eggs;
pepper and salt; 1 small onion.</p>

<p>Soak the peas all night. In the morning put them and
the onion into a farina-kettle with just enough water to
cover them. Boil two hours, or until soft. Drain, and
pulp through a colander. Beat in butter, pepper, salt, and
eggs, and boil in a buttered mould or floured cloth one
hour. Turn out, and cut in slices on the table.</p>

<p>Prepare as usual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, slice, and stew juicy apples with just enough water
to keep them from burning. Mash when soft and broken
to pieces, and beat smooth with a good lump of butter
and plenty of sugar. Serve cold.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>2 cupfuls of fine crumbs; 2 cupfuls of chopped apples;
1 cupful of sugar; 1 teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and
mace; half as much grated lemon-peel; juice of a lemon;
1 tablespoonful of brandy; ¼ lb. raisins, seeded and
chopped; 4 eggs; 1 cup of milk; pinch of soda in the
milk.</p>

<p>Scald the milk; pour upon the crumbs, and beat light.
Add beaten yolks, sugar, fruit, and spice—at last, the
whites. Bake in a buttered dish, covered, half an hour;
then uncover and drain. Eat hot with sweet sauce. It
is very good.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Game Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 grouse or partridges, or, if you have neither, use a pair
of rabbits; ½ lb. of lean ham; 2 medium-sized onions; 1
lb. of lean beef; fried bread; butter for frying; pepper,
salt, and 2 stalks of white celery cut into inch lengths;
3 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Joint your game neatly; cut the ham and onions into
small pieces, and fry all in butter to a light brown. Put
into a soup-pot with the beef, cut into strips, and a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
pepper. Pour on the water; heat slowly, and stew gently
two hours. Take out the pieces of bird, and cover in a
bowl; cook the soup an hour longer; strain; cool; drop
in the celery, and simmer ten minutes. Pour upon fried
bread in the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricassee of Grouse.</span></h3>

<p>Make a cup of drawn butter by heating a cup of
strained broth from your boiling soup in a saucepan; stirring
into it two tablespoonfuls of butter cut up in a teaspoonful
of flour; season well, and put in the pieces of
grouse, or rabbit. Simmer until very hot; take out the
meat and arrange upon buttered toast in a dish. Add to
the gravy a couple of beaten yolks; heat one minute, and
pour over the birds.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes with Vermicelli.</span></h3>

<p>Mash and whip the potatoes light with butter and milk.
Season with salt, and mound smoothly within a stone-china
dish, or a bake-dish that has a silver stand for the
table. Wash over with white of egg, and strew with vermicelli
that has been broken small, boiled a few minutes
in hot water, then spread out to drain upon a sieve.
Brown in a quick oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Buttered Parsnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil tender, and scrape. Slice a quarter of an inch
thick, lengthwise. Put into a saucepan with a great
spoonful of melted butter, pepper and salt, and a little
chopped parsley. Shake over the fire until it boils. Lay
the parsnips upon a dish, and pour the sauce over them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Empty a can of tomatoes into a saucepan. Stew
twenty-five minutes; season with pepper, salt, sugar, and
stir in a lump of butter rolled in flour. Simmer ten minutes,
and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Quaking Custard.</span></h3>

<p>3 cups of milk; yolks of 3 eggs, using the whites for
the <i>méringue</i>; ½ package Cooper’s gelatine; 6 tablespoonfuls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
of sugar; juice of 1 lemon for <i>méringue</i>; flavoring
extract for custard.</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine two hours in a cup of the milk. Heat
the rest of the milk; add that in which the gelatine is,
and stir over the fire until the gelatine is melted. Take
from the fire and pour upon the beaten yolks and sugar.
Heat slowly, and stir until it thickens well. Cool, stirring
every quarter of an hour. When cold, flavor and pour
into a wet mould. Set in ice, or in a cold place. When
it is firm, turn out and surround with a <i>méringue</i> made by
whipping the whites stiff with a little powdered sugar, and
the lemon-juice.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Turnip Soup.</span></h3>

<p>12 turnips; 3 tablespoonfuls of butter; 1 onion; 2
stalks of celery; bunch of herbs; 2 cups of milk; pepper
and salt; 2 quarts of water; 1 tablespoonful—even—of
flour.</p>

<p>Pare and lay the turnips in cold water half an hour.
Slice into the soup-pot, with the onion and celery; also
the chopped herbs. Pour on two quarts of cold water,
and boil until the vegetables are broken to pieces. Rub,
with their liquor, through a sieve. Season, and return to
the fire. When it boils, stir in the butter cut up in the
flour; cook five minutes; pour into the tureen, and add
the boiling milk.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Cod.</span></h3>

<p>Sew the fish up in a piece of mosquito-netting. Put on
in plenty of boiling water, a little salt, allowing <i>about</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
twelve minutes per pound. Unwrap; lay upon a hot dish,
and pour over it—serving some in a boat—a cupful of
drawn butter made from the fish pot-liquor, and containing,
besides butter and flour, the pounded yolks of two boiled
eggs, and a tablespoonful of chopped green pickle.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash, and pass with the fish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricasseed Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>7 or 8 hard-boiled eggs, laid in cold water so soon as
they are done; a cup of gravy left from yesterday’s soup;
a little cold chopped meat; melted butter, pepper, salt,
and French mustard; three tablespoonfuls of cream.</p>

<p>Cut the cold eggs, crosswise; take out the yolks; slice
a bit from the bottom of each white “cup” thus made,
and stand them closely together in a flat dish. Rub the
yolks to a paste with the butter; mix with the chopped
meat and seasoning, and make into round balls, with
which fill your “cups.” Heat, and add the cream to the
gravy, and pour over the eggs. Set in the oven three
minutes to heat; stick a bit of parsley in the top of each
ball, and send to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Succotash.</span></h3>

<p>Turn out a can of succotash into a saucepan; barely
cover with hot water, and cook half an hour. Pour off
the water; put on, instead, a cup of cold milk. Bring to
a boil; pepper, salt, and put in a lump of butter, rolled
in flour. Simmer five minutes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate Tartlets.</span></h3>

<p>4 eggs; ½ cake Baker’s chocolate, grated; 1 tablespoonful
corn-starch, dissolved in milk; 3 tablespoonfuls
of milk; 4 tablespoonfuls of white sugar; 2 tablespoonfuls
of vanilla; ½ teaspoonful cinnamon, and a little salt;
1 heaping teaspoonful of melted butter.</p>

<p>Rub the chocolate smooth in the milk; heat over the
fire, and add the corn-starch wet in more milk. Stir until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
thickened, and pour out. When cold, beat in the yolks
and sugar, with the flavoring. Bake in open shells lining
paté-pans. Cover with a <i>méringue</i> made of the whites
and a little powdered sugar, when they are nearly done,
and let them color slightly. Eat cold.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Winter Pea Soup.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of beef, cut into strips; 1 lb. of lean ham; 2 lbs.
of cracked bones; 5 quarts of water; 1 turnip, sliced; 2
onions, chopped; pepper; salt; 3 stalks of celery; 1
pint of split peas.</p>

<p>Soak the peas all night. In the morning, put them on
in a farina-kettle covered with a quart of warm water, and
cook soft. Put into a soup-kettle the beef, ham, and
vegetables, with five quarts of water, and cook slowly
four hours, filling up with hot water should the water sink
below four quarts. Strain off the liquor; pick out meat
and bones from the colander; put into the stock-jar, and
season well. Pour over them all but three pints of the
soup, and set away. Pulp the vegetables through the
colander into to-day’s broth; season, and add the peas,
also rubbed through a colander. Cook slowly, stirring
often, half an hour, and pour upon dice of fried bread
into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ham and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Boil slices of ham fifteen minutes, and let them get
cold. Trim and cut into pieces of uniform size; put a
small piece of butter in a frying-pan, and cook the ham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
not too quickly, turning when the under side is done. Strain
the fat when the ham has been taken out and put upon
a hot-water dish; return to the fire, and fry the eggs.
Cut off the ragged edges and lay one upon each slice of
ham.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni with Cod.</span></h3>

<p>Break a quarter of a pound of macaroni into short
pieces; boil twenty minutes in hot salted water; drain;
stir in a tablespoonful of butter and three tablespoonfuls
of grated cheese; mix up with one-third as much chopped
cod as you have macaroni, and put into a buttered bake-dish.
Wet with a little milk; scatter bread-crumbs on
the top, and bake, covered, half an hour, then brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Boil as directed on Sunday of this week; put a little
dripping in a frying-pan with a little powdered, or
chopped parsley; heat, put in the beans, and stir until
they are a pale yellow; pepper and salt, and serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Slaw, with Cream Dressing.</span></h3>

<p>1 small head of white cabbage, chopped fine; 1 cup
scalding milk; rather less than a cup of vinegar; 1
tablespoonful of butter; 2 beaten eggs; 1 tablespoonful
of white sugar; 1 teaspoonful essence of celery; pepper
and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Heat milk and vinegar in separate vessels. Put butter,
sugar, and seasoning into the hot vinegar. Boil up once,
and put in the cabbage. Heat to scalding and take off.
Add the beaten eggs to the hot milk; cook until they begin
to thicken. Put the hot cabbage into a bowl; pour
the custard over it; toss and stir with a silver fork; cover
to keep in the strength of the vinegar, and cool suddenly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Squash Pie.</span></h3>

<p>1 pint of stewed and strained squash; 1 pint of milk;
¾ cup of sugar; 3 eggs, beaten light; ½ teaspoonful of ginger,
and same of mace and cinnamon mixed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Potage au Riz.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the top of the soup-stock. Pour off
and strain what is needed for to-day. Heat and skim;
add half a cup of rice which has been cooked soft in a
little milk—also the milk which has not been soaked up;
put in what seasoning is needed; simmer fifteen minutes,
and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Turkey.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, and wash out the crop and body of the turkey
with soda and water, rinsing it out afterwards. Stuff with
a force-meat made of crumbs, a little cooked sausage, pepper,
salt, and a little butter. Truss the turkey neatly.
(Salt the giblets, and set by for to-morrow’s soup.) Lay
it in the dripping-pan; pour boiling water over it, and roast
about ten minutes to the pound, after the cooking actually
commences. Cook slowly at first, or it will be dry without
and raw within. Baste often and freely. Ten minutes
before taking it up, dredge with flour, and baste with butter.
Pour off the fat from the top of the gravy, thicken
with browned flour, and season; boil once and serve in a
boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cranberry Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Put a quart of clean cranberries into a saucepan, with
a cupful of cold water. Stew slowly, stirring often, for an
hour and a half. Take from the fire, and sweeten abundantly
with sugar; rub through a fine colander and set to
form in a wet mould. Do this on Saturday.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes—Browned.</span></h3>

<p>Whip light with milk, butter, and salt; pile upon a
greased pie-dish, and brown in a good oven. Slip to a
hot dish by the aid of your cake-turner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil until tender; strip off the skins; lay in an oven to
dry for some minutes and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Queen’s Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups of milk; 4 eggs; ½ package of gelatine; ½ cup
of sugar; vanilla or other essence; 1 sponge-cake; 2
glasses of wine; raspberry or other jelly.</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine in the milk for one hour. Put into a
farina-kettle and heat to boiling, stirring until the gelatine
is dissolved. Pour upon the beaten eggs and sugar; return
to the fire and cook one minute. Pour half, when
cold, into a wet mould. After half an hour, cover this
with slices of sponge cake with jelly spread between them.
Wet these well with wine. Add the rest of the custard,
and set the mould upon ice, or in a cold place.</p>

<p>Make this pudding on Saturday.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Giblet Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Boil the turkey-giblets in a quart of water. Take them
out; add the water to the entire contents of your stock-pot,
and simmer at the back of the range for one hour,
adding water if it should boil down. Strain and season.
Have ready the giblets—the gizzard chopped fine, the
liver pounded with half a cupful of turkey-stuffing. Cook
all together fifteen minutes, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Turkey Scallop.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the meat from your cold turkey. Break the bones,
cover them with two quarts of cold water; boil one hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
season and put into a bowl. Chop the meat and season
with pepper and salt. Put a layer of buttered crumbs in
the bottom of a bake-dish; cover with the mince; moisten
with gravy; more crumbs buttered and wet with milk.
Having filled the dish in this way, cover with cracker-crumbs,
seasoned, wet with oyster-liquor (or milk) and
beaten light with two eggs. Strew butter on top; bake,
covered, half an hour; then brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Rice.</span></h3>

<p>Skim the fat from the cooled broth made by boiling
your turkey-bones. Put into a saucepan with a cup of
soaked rice, and cook until the latter is soft, shaking the
pot from time to time. Drain off the liquor, and put into
your stock-pot; serve the boiled rice in a deep dish, and
pass grated cheese with it.</p>

<i>méringue</i> made of the whites of three beaten eggs and a
little sugar. Shut up in the oven a few minutes, to “set.”
You can keep raw paste in a cold place from Saturday
to Monday, and spare yourself the trouble of making it

1 qt. of oysters; 1 cup of milk; 2 teaspoonfuls of flour; 1
tablespoonful of butter cut up in the flour; 2 stalks of
celery; pepper and salt; 6 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Put meat, bones, celery, and water over the fire and
cook slowly four hours. Strain; put meat and bones,
highly seasoned, into your stock-jar with all the soup except
two quarts, and set away. Cool and take the fat
from that kept out for to-day; return to the fire with
seasoning. When it boils, add the oysters. Cook five
minutes; pour out and add the boiling milk thickened
with the floured butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak Pie.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of steak; 1 chopped onion; 1 tablespoonful of
mushroom catsup; a little water; 1 tablespoonful of butter
cut up into floured bits; pepper and salt; some good
plain paste.</p>

<p>Cut the steaks into small squares; beat each flat, and
leave out bone, fat, and gristle. Strew a little onion in the
bottom of a bake-dish; put in a layer of meat, peppered
and salted; scatter bits of floured butter over it; then
more onion. When all are in, pour in the catsup and a
little water—or gravy is better—cover with crust, and bake
nearly two hours.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ladies’ Cabbage au Maître d’Hôtel.</span></h3>

<p>Boil a cabbage in two waters. (Salt the second, and
put into your stock-pot.) Let it get perfectly cold; chop
fine; mix with two beaten eggs, a few spoonfuls of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
soup-stock, a great spoonful of butter, the juice of a

Add milk and butter, salt to taste, and when very soft,
pour into a buttered saucepan. Stir until hot and stiff;
pour into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned French Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Clip the beans into short and equal lengths. Put into
a saucepan, cover with hot salted water, and stew half an
hour. Drain, stir in a lump of butter, with pepper and
salt, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Flour Hasty Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Heat to boiling a quart of milk. Salt, and stir in three
tablespoonfuls of flour, rubbed smooth in a little cold
milk. Boil and stir fifteen minutes, and add a tablespoonful
of butter. Cook two minutes; turn into an uncovered
deep dish, and eat with butter and sugar, or cream and
sugar. Sprinkle each saucerful with nutmeg.</p>

clusters, and drop into the soup when you have brought
it again to a boil. Cook slowly fifteen minutes. Stir in
a tablespoonful of butter cut up in half as much flour.
Season to taste; boil up fairly, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pork Chops, with Tomato Gravy.</span></h3>

<p>Trim off skin and fat; rub all over with a mixture of
powdered sage and onion. Put a small piece of butter
into a frying-pan; put in the chops, and cook rather
slowly, as they should be well done. Lay the chops upon
a hot dish; add a little hot water to the gravy in the pan;
a great spoonful of butter rolled in flour; pepper, salt,
and sugar, and half a cup of juice drained from a can of
tomatoes—keeping the tomatoes themselves for a tomato
omelette for breakfast. Stew five minutes, and pour over
the chops.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beets.</span></h3>

<p>Wash; cut off the tops; boil more than an hour;
scrape. Cut into round slices, and put into a root-dish.

<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Cream Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Boil an old fowl, with an onion, in four quarts of cold
water, until there remain but two quarts. Take it out,

the butter. Add half a cupful of gravy, and, when well
mixed, turn all into a saucepan. Put in the rabbits,
jointed as for fricassee, the sliced bacon, and lemon. Season;
cover closely, and stew an hour, or until the meat is
tender. Thicken with browned flour; boil once, and
pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Parsnip Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape and halve the parsnips. Boil tender in hot
salted water. Mash smooth, picking out the woody bits.
Add a beaten egg to every four parsnips, a teaspoonful of
flour—pepper and salt at your discretion, and enough
milk to make into a thick batter. Drop, by the spoonful,
into hot lard, and fry brown. Drain in a hot colander,
and dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Celery.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape, and cut into short bits. Cook tender in hot
salted water. Pour this off; add enough cold milk to
cover the celery. Heat to a boil; stir in a good spoonful
of butter rolled in flour, pepper and salt. Stew five minutes
longer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Glazed Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil soft, peel carefully, and lay in a greased dripping-pan
in a good oven. As they begin to crust over, baste
with a little butter, repeating this several times, as they
brown. When glossy, and of a golden russet, dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Tartlets.</span></h3>

<p>2 fine oranges, juice of both, and grated peel of one; ¾
cup of sugar; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter; juice of ½ a
lemon; 1 teaspoonful of corn-starch, wet up with lemon-juice
and a little cold water.</p>

<p>Beat all to a smooth cream, and bake in small paste
shells.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Egg Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Heat all your soup-stock, adding hot water, should
there not be two quarts. Cook gently half an hour;
strain, pressing all the strength out of the meat; cool,
skim off the fat; season; return to the fire, and when it
boils, pour upon six beaten raw eggs. Put back into the
soup-kettle, and stir until it <i>begins</i> to thicken. It must
not boil. Put strips of crisp toast into the tureen, and
pour on the soup.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Panned Oysters.</span></h3>

<p>Butter a number of small tins with upright sides, like
those of muffin-rings. Cut rounds of bread to fit the
bottoms; toast these, butter well, and fit each into its
place. Wet with oyster-liquor; then lay in as many
oysters as the tins will hold; dust with pepper and salt;
put a bit of butter upon each, arrange the tins in a large
dripping-pan; cover with another to keep in steam, and
flavor, and cook eight minutes, or until the oysters “ruffle.”
Send up in the tins—“hot and hot.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fowl and Rice Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the meat from the skeleton of your cold chicken.
Break up the bones, and cover with a quart of cold water,
adding skin and gristle. Boil down to a pint, cool, take
off the fat; return to the fire; salt, and put in half a cupful
of raw rice. Cook in a farina-kettle until the rice
is soft and dry; stir in, then, a tablespoonful of butter,
and turn upon a flat dish, to cool. Meanwhile, put the
minced chicken into a saucepan with a little of yesterday’s
soup; season, and stir over the fire until very hot. Beat
a raw egg into the cold rice; flour your hands, and make
into oblong flat cakes. Put a great spoonful of mince in
the hollowed centre of each; enclose by folding the rice
upon it; roll each in flour; then in raw egg; lastly in
pounded cracker, and fry to a fine yellow brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à l’Italienne.</span></h3>

<p>Whip the boiled potatoes to a dry meal with a fork;
still using the fork, beat in butter, salt, pepper, and two
tablespoonfuls of cream. Pile, like rock-work, upon
a stone-china dish, or within a pudding-dish that has a
silver stand for the table, and brown delicately and quickly
upon the upper grating of the oven.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Corn Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Drain and chop the corn; add a cupful of milk, 2
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, and 1 of sugar; pepper,
salt, and 2 beaten eggs. Beat all light; pour in a
greased bake-dish; bake, covered, half an hour; then
brown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Custards and Cake.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; yolks of 5 eggs and the whites of 2,
reserving 3 for the <i>méringue</i>; 6 tablespoonfuls of sugar;
flavoring extract, 1 teaspoonful to the pint.</p>

<p>Heat the milk to scalding; pour gradually, upon the
beaten yolks and two whites, whipped light with the sugar.
Return to the custard-kettle, and stir until it begins to
thicken. When cold, flavor; pour into glass or china
cups; whip the whites to a froth with a little sugar, and
pile upon the top. Lay a preserved berry, or a bit of
bright jelly, upon the top of each snowy heap. Eat with
cake.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Good Beef Soup.</span></h3>

<p>6 lbs. of shin beef, cut in strips; 2 lbs. of bones,
cracked; 4 stalks of celery; 1 onion; 3 carrots; 2 turnips;
bunch of sweet herbs; pepper and salt; 7 quarts
of water.</p>

<p>Put on the meat and bones in the water, and cook
slowly, skimming often, for two hours. Add the herbs
and all the sliced vegetables except one carrot, and cook
two hours more. Strain off the liquor; put bones and
meat, well seasoned, into your stock-pot; add the soup
(there should be at least five quarts in all) except
what is needed for to-day, and put away for future use.
Pulp the vegetables into to-day’s soup; cool, take off the
fat; season; put back over the fire; add the reserved carrot,
which should have been cut into dice and cooked by
itself in a little water; simmer ten minutes, and pour out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Breaded Lamb Chops.</span></h3>

<p>Trim neatly; flatten with the side of a hatchet; pepper
and salt; dip into beaten egg, then in cracker-dust,
and fry in good dripping, turning when the lower side is
done. Drain off the fat, and lay upon a dish, overlapping
each other, with a wall of fried potatoes around them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare; slice thin; lay in cold water half an hour; dry
between two towels, and fry to a light brown in nice dripping
or salted lard. Shake off all the fat in a hot colander,
and pile around the chops.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Drain off most of the liquid from a can of tomatoes
into the boiling soup-kettle. Put a layer of crumbs in the
bottom of a buttered bake-dish; butter them, and lay in
the tomatoes, seasoned with pepper, salt, and sugar.
Cover with buttered crumbs, and bake, covered, half an
hour—then brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Cook in two waters—the second, salted and boiling.
When tender, drain; set closely together in a bake-dish.
Pepper, salt, and butter liberally; pour over them a little
of your soup-stock, strained through a cloth; brown in a
good oven; lay in a deep dish, and pour over them the
gravy thickened with browned flour, and cooked one
minute.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Suet Dumplings.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups fine crumbs soaked in a cup of hot milk; 1 cup
powdered suet; 4 beaten eggs; 1 tablespoonful of sugar;
1 teaspoonful cream-tartar mixed with 1 tablespoonful
of flour; ½ teaspoonful of soda dissolved in the milk; a
little salt.</p>

<p>Beat the eggs into the soaked crumbs; add salt, suet,
sugar, lastly, the flour. Beat and knead hard, make into
balls; put into floured cloths; leave room to swell; tie
tightly, and boil one hour. Eat hot, with sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Skim your stock; pour off and strain two quarts; heat
to a slow boil; add a tablespoonful of walnut catsup;
skim well, and drop in half a cupful of fancy macaroni,
which has been cooked ten minutes in a little boiling
water. Simmer five minutes, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Goose.</span></h3>

<p>Be wary in the selection of even what the poulterer
assures you is a “green goose,” and should you be
“sold,” as well as the bird, take the disappointment
good-naturedly. Wash out and wipe dry the body of the
goose; add to the usual dressing of crumbs, pepper, salt,
etc., a tablespoonful of melted butter; a tablespoonful
of minced onion; half as much powdered sage, some bits
of fat pork, and the yolks of two eggs. Put into the dripping-pan
with two cupfuls of boiling water, and roast, if
of fair size, two hours, basting often and very copiously.
When half done, cover the breast with a stiff paste of
flour and water, removing when you are ready to brown
it. Take the fat from the gravy; thicken with browned
flour, add a glass of sherry, salt, and pepper; boil and
serve in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>See Wednesday, Second Week in November.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Cook as directed on Sunday, Third Week in November.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned String-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>See “French Beans,” Tuesday, Third Week in November.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower.</span></h3>

<p>Tie in a net, and cook about forty-five minutes in boiling,
salted water. Drain; lay in a deep dish, blossom
upward, and pour on a cupful of rich drawn butter, with
the juice of a lemon stirred in.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chocolate and Cocoanut Blanc-Mange.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 3 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch—heaping;
1 cup of sugar; whites of 4 eggs; vanilla flavoring;
3 tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate; 1 grated cocoanut.</p>

<p>Heat the milk; rub the corn-starch smooth with a little
cold milk; stir into the hot milk, first the sugar, then the
corn-starch. When it is a smooth paste, whip in the
frothed whites; cook one minute, and pour off half of the
mixture into a bowl upon half the grated cocoanut. Beat
in well. Add to that on the fire the chocolate, rubbed
smooth in a little milk, and stir until the blanc-mange is
colored. Wet a mould; when the chocolate-mixture is
cold, pour half into the mould, and set where it will get
cold fast. After half an hour, or so soon as it will bear
the weight, put the cocoanut in carefully, and when this
is quite firm, add the rest of the chocolate. Next day
turn it out upon a dish, and heap the other half of the
cocoanut—newly grated—over it. Send around a good
boiled custard cold with it. Do this on Saturday.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Medley Soup.</span></h3>

<p>When you have cut the meat from the carcass of the
goose, break up the bones; put on with the stuffing in
two quarts of water, and boil down to one. Strain; skim;
add what stock remains in your stock-jar, and simmer
half an hour. The stuffing should thicken the soup sufficiently,
and almost season it. Pour out into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Réchauffé of Goose.</span></h3>

<p>Cut the meat into neat slices, and lay in a saucepan
with minced ham, and a little onion between the slices.
Cover with gravy, and heat slowly until near the boiling-point.
Take up the meat; lay upon a dish; thicken the
gravy with browned flour; add a spoonful of currant jelly;
boil up, and pour over the meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Salsify.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape, and cut each root in two, dropping into water
as you scrape them. Stew in boiling water, a little salt,
until tender; pour off the water; add enough milk to
cover the roots; when it boils, stir in a piece of butter
rolled in flour; pepper and salt; simmer five minutes,
and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Cones—Baked.</span></h3>

<p>Mash or whip boiled potatoes light; mix with a little
very finely minced parsley a little butter, a great spoonful
of cream, and the yolks of two beaten eggs. Make
into cone-shaped loaves, about as large as an egg; set
in a greased baking-pan; wash over with beaten egg, and
brown in a quick oven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Bean Soup.</span></h3>

<p>On Monday morning put a quart of beans in soak. By
evening, put them to boil at the back of the range, and
cook until soft. Early on Tuesday morning put them
into a pudding-dish with a pound of parboiled streaked
pork, and bake brown. Cut the bacon into strips; put
into a soup-pot with the beans, a sliced onion, and three
stalks of celery. Pour on three quarts of cold water, and
boil down to two. Rub through a colander; return to
the fire; season to taste; add a teaspoonful of flour into
which a tablespoonful of butter has been rubbed. Simmer
ten minutes, and pour upon dice of fried bread
placed in the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Cutlets.</span></h3>

<p>Flatten with side of a hatchet; pepper, salt, dip in raw
egg, then in cracker-dust; fry in a little butter, turning as
they brown. Dish, and pour over them some drawn butter
in which has been cooked a great spoonful of tomato
catsup.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Parsnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil tender in a little hot water, salted. Scrape, cut into
long slices; dredge with flour and fry in hot lard or dripping.
Drain off the fat, and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sausage and Cabbage.</span></h3>

<p>Quarter and parboil a fine, white cabbage, and put
on to boil in hot water with six or eight “link” sausages,
having previously pricked these slightly. When the cabbage
is tender, drain and chop, adding pepper, salt, a
little butter and vinegar heated together. Pile upon a
hot dish, laying the sausages about the cabbage.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Celery Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape and cut blanched celery into inch lengths. Put
into a glass dish, and pour over it a dressing made by rubbing
a teaspoonful of sugar with half as much, each, of pepper,
salt, and made mustard, with two tablespoonfuls of
oil, and twice the quantity of vinegar, added gradually.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup macaroni broken into equal lengths; 1 quart of
milk; 4 eggs; ½ lemon; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter; ¾
cup of sugar, a little mace.</p>

<p>Simmer the macaroni in half the milk until tender. Heat
and add the other pint. While hot stir in the butter, the
yolks beaten up with sugar, the mace, lemon-juice and
peel—finally the whisked whites. Bake half an hour in a
buttered mould—covered—then brown.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Venison Soup.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of venison, the coarser parts of the meat will do;
1 lb. lean ham; 1 onion sliced; 3 stalks of celery; 5<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
quarts of water; 1 can of corn, drained and chopped,

pressing hard; cool, skim, and return the soup to the fire
with the chopped corn. Stew half an hour; add the
seasoning, a lump of butter rolled in flour, a half-cup of
tomato-juice, and simmer ten minutes more.</p>

<p>If you cannot get venison use mutton for this soup.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Leg of Mutton.</span></h3>

<p>Put on in plenty of boiling water, a little salt. Cook
fifteen minutes to the pound. When done, wipe dry and
rub all over with butter. Make a boat of drawn butter,
using as a base a cup of the strained pot-liquor, and, when
made, add a great spoonful of chopped cucumber pickle.</p>

<p>Of course you will pour the pot-liquor into the stock-jar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, quarter, and cook the turnips tender in boiling
salted water. Mash in a hot colander; add butter, pepper,
and salt, and serve in a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>See Thursday, Second Week in November.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stuffed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Bake large potatoes soft, and cut a round piece from
the top of each. Scrape out the insides carefully and
mash smooth with butter, cream, and a little grated cheese.</p>

<p>Beat soft with milk, season with pepper and salt, and
heat in a greased saucepan, stirring all the time. Fill the
skins with the mixture, put on the caps and set in the

whites and flour alternately with milk, until the batter is
of the right consistency. Run a teaspoonful of lard over
the bottom of a hot frying-pan, pour in a large ladleful of
batter, and fry quickly. Roll the pancake up like a sheet
of paper; lay upon a hot dish; put in more lard, and fry
another pancake. Keep hot over boiling water, sending
half a dozen to the table at a time. Eat with sauce.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mutton and Rice Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take all the fat from the liquor in which your mutton
was boiled; put it over the fire with a cup of raw rice,
and cook slowly until the latter is boiled to pieces.
Strain through the soup-sieve, add seasoning to taste, and
some finely minced parsley. Heat to boiling, and pour
into the tureen. Add a cup of hot milk, in which have
been beaten two raw eggs—the milk having cooked for a
minute to thicken them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chickens à la Viennoise.</span></h3>

<p>Clean, wash, and wipe a pair of chickens. Parboil the
giblets; chop them fine, with a very little onion, the
pounded yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, and seasoning to
your taste. Add a handful of crumbs, and stuff the
chickens with this force-meat. Boil in plenty of hot water,
slightly salt, three-quarters of an hour, having sewed up
each in coarse netting. Put them into a broad saucepan,
in which have been melted two tablespoonfuls of nice
dripping, and the same of butter. The fowls should have
been wiped dry, and the fat be hot when you put them in.
Turn twice while you brown them over a quick fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>.
When russet-colored all over, dish, and pour over them a
few spoonfuls of butter, heated with a tablespoonful of
tomato catsup. Save the liquor in which the fowls were
boiled.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hominy Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups of fine-grained hominy, boiled, and cold; 2
beaten eggs; 2 tablespoonfuls melted butter; 1 tablespoonful
of sugar; salt to taste.</p>

<p>Rub butter and sugar into the hominy until the latter is
smooth; then beat in the eggs. Make into rolls with
floured hands; roll in flour, and fry to a good color.
Drain well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach.</span></h3>

<p>Pick off the leaves. Boil in hot salted water twenty
minutes. Drain, chop fine, and return to the saucepan,
with a piece of butter, salt, sugar, pepper, and a pinch of
mace. Beat in two tablespoonfuls of cream, and, when
smooth and hot, turn out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Soak the dried beans all night; then proceed as with
“Kidney Beans à l’Anglaise,” on Sunday, Second Week
in November. Cook enough for a hot dish to-day, and
bean salad to-morrow.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bread and Custard Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 2 even cups of dried crumbs; 4 eggs;
5 tablespoonfuls of sugar; cinnamon; ½ lb. raisins, seeded
and chopped; 2 tablespoonfuls melted butter.</p>

<p>Soak the crumbs in a pint of the milk, and heat to
scalding in a custard-kettle. Beat to a mush; put in the
butter, and beat again one minute. Butter a pudding-dish;
pour a half-cupful of the mush in the bottom;
sprinkle with cinnamon, and strew with raisins, more batter,
spice, and fruit, until all are in. Heat the other pint
of milk; pour upon the beaten yolks and sugar; pour
this custard, without boiling, over the pudding. Bake,
covered, half an hour. Uncover, spread upon the custard—if
fully “set”—a <i>méringue</i> of the whites, whipped stiff
with a little powdered sugar. Eat warm—not hot—with
cream and sugar, or butter and sugar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Graham Soup.</span></h3>

<p>3 onions; 3 carrots; 3 turnips; ½ cabbage; 6 stalks
of celery; ½ can of tomatoes; 3 tablespoonfuls of butter
rolled in flour; ½ cup of milk (cream is better); pepper
and salt; 3 quarts of water; a little sugar; sweet herbs.</p>

<p>Chop the vegetables, and put all over the fire in the
water, excepting the cabbage and tomatoes. Parboil the
cabbage, and add at the end of half an hour’s boil. Half
an hour later, put in the tomatoes and chopped herbs.
Boil sharply twenty minutes; add sugar, pepper, and salt.
Rub the soup through a colander. Return to the fire;
stir in the floured butter; simmer five minutes, turn into
the tureen, and stir in the hot milk or cream.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fricassee of Salmon.</span></h3>

<p>1 can fresh salmon; 2 beaten eggs; 1 cup of drawn butter;
1 teaspoonful anchovy sauce; 2 hard-boiled eggs,
chopped fine; cayenne and salt to taste; capers, or
minced green pickles.</p>

<p>Stew the fish—broken into rather coarse bits—in the
can-liquor ten minutes. If there is not enough liquor,
cook in a little water. Add the drawn butter, and, when
these are well mixed, the beaten eggs. Stir five minutes;
put in the chopped eggs and pickles. Heat one minute,
and pour into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken Dumplings.</span></h3>

<p>Meat from your cold fowls, minced fine; ½ cup of
gravy; yolks of 3 raw eggs; 1 tablespoonful of flour; pepper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
and salt; batter made of 1 egg; ½ cup of milk, and
a little flour; cracker-crumbs.</p>

<p>Put chopped meat and seasoning, with a little of the
liquor in which the chickens were boiled, into a saucepan,
and heat to a gentle boil. Stir in the flour wet in a little
cold water, and a minute later the beaten yolks. Stir to
thickening; pour out, and let it get cold and stiff. Flour
your hands, and make the paste into flattened balls. Roll
in cracker-dust, dip in the batter, again in the cracker,
and fry in hot lard. Drain, and serve hot.</p>

<p>N.B.—Boil the skeletons and stuffing of the chickens
in the rest of the pot-liquor, and put by, well seasoned,
in the stock-jar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salsify Sauté.</span></h3>

<p>See Thursday, First Week in November.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni with Bacon.</span></h3>

<p>Boil half a pound of macaroni, broken up small, in a
little weak “stock,” salted, twenty minutes. Drain;
stir in a quarter of a pound of streaked bacon, boiled and
minced <i>very</i> fine; put into a buttered bake-dish; pour
on a very little soup-stock; cover with rolled crackers,
seasoned well; put bits of butter on top; bake, covered,
half an hour—then brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bean Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Put the cold Lima beans into a salad-dish; and pour on
such a dressing as was made for cold slaw on Monday,
First Week in November.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pumpkin Pie.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart milk; 1 pint stewed pumpkin, rubbed through
a colander; 4 eggs; 1 teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and
mace, and half as much nutmeg; 1 scant cup of sugar; a
little salt. Beat all well together, and bake in open crust.
Eat cold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ox-Head Soup.</span></h3>

<p>½ an ox’s head, well cleaned, including the fresh tongue;
6 potatoes, boiled and mashed; 3 turnips; 3 onions; 4
carrots; 4 stalks of celery; pepper, salt, and mace;
bunch of sweet herbs; 8 quarts of water; the stock
already in your jar.</p>

<p>Put the head, tongue, and vegetables (leaving out the
potatoes) over the fire, with the water, early in the day.
Bring slowly to boiling, and keep this up five hours. At
the end of three hours take out the tongue with enough
liquor to cover it, and let it get cold. When the five
hours have passed, strain off the liquor; take out bones
and meat; season highly, and put into your emptied and
scalded stock-jar. Pulp the vegetables into the soup;
season it, and pour all not needed for to-day into the
stock-pot. Add to that kept out the skimmed and strained
broth made yesterday from the chicken-bones; the potatoes,
boiled and rubbed hot through the colander. Boil
slowly ten minutes, and pour out. When tongue and the
stock in the jar are both cold, add the one to the other.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pork Steaks.</span></h3>

<p>Cook precisely as you do beefsteak, only for a much
longer time, and turn oftener. When you have laid them
upon a hot dish, anoint on both sides with butter mixed
and heated with pepper, salt, powdered sage, and a little
minced onion. Cover, and let them stand for a few minutes
before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Sauce.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>See Wednesday of this week.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes Scalloped with Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups of mashed potatoes; 3 tablespoonfuls of milk,
and 2 of butter; yolks of 4 hard-boiled eggs; 1 beaten
raw egg; handful fine crumbs; salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Beat the hot potatoes smooth with milk, butter, and
raw egg, and season well. Put a layer in the bottom of a
buttered bake-dish; then one of sliced yolks, peppered
and salted. Fill the dish in this order, having potatoes on
top. Strew with crumbs; cover; bake half an hour, and
brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Pie and Cream.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, core, and slice juicy, well-flavored apples; line
pie-dishes with a good crust; put in a layer of fruit; strew
well with sugar; scatter half a dozen whole cloves upon
these; lay on more apples, and so on, until the dish is
full. Cover with crust, and bake. Sift powdered sugar
upon the top and eat, just warm, with—or without—cream.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Soup à la Langue.</span></h3>

<p>Take fat from your soup-stock. Pour out two quarts
into the soup-kettle; heat slowly and skim carefully.
Meanwhile, take out the beef’s tongue from the jar;
skin, and cut up the best parts of it into small dice.
There should be a large cupful of these. Drop into the
soup, add a tablespoonful of catsup, and nearly a teaspoonful
of French mustard. When the soup begins to
boil again, pour it out.</p>

<p>Return the refuse parts of the tongue to the stock-jar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Haunch of Venison.</span></h3>

<p>Wash well in lukewarm water; then, rub all over with
butter. Cover on all sides with a stiff paste of flour and
water, and put down to roast, pouring a little water into
the baking-pan. Now and then, wet the paste to keep it
from cracking. Roast from three to four hours. Half
an hour before taking it up, remove the paste, and test
with a skewer to see if it is done. Set down again to
roast, and baste every five minutes, with claret and melted
butter. At the last, dredge with flour, baste with butter,
and brown. For gravy, add to the liquid in the dripping-pan
a thickening of browned flour, a teaspoonful of currant
jelly, a glass of claret, pepper and salt to taste.
Boil up, and serve in a boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in hot water until a fork will enter the largest
easily; peel; lay in a dripping-pan, and set in a good
oven a few minutes to dry out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Moulded Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash boiled potatoes with milk, butter, and salt—not
too soft; press hard into a greased mould, and turn out
upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Celery.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape and cut into equal lengths the best stalks of a
bunch of celery. Cook tender in boiling water, a little
salt; drain, pepper and salt, and when dished pour on a
cupful of drawn butter in which has been stirred the juice
of half a lemon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Barley Custard.</span></h3>

<p>½ cup of pearl barley; 1 quart of milk; 5 eggs; 1
dessertspoonful of corn-starch wet up in a little cold
milk; nearly a cupful of sugar; a pinch of salt; vanilla,
or other flavoring.</p>

<p>Boil the barley tender in just enough water to cover it,
with a pinch of salt. Drain, and put into a custard-kettle
with the milk. Heat slowly, and when it fairly boils,
pour upon the beaten eggs and sugar. Return to the
fire; stir until thick; turn into a bowl, and, when cold,
flavor. On Sunday, pour into custard-cups, with, if you
like, a spoonful of whipped cream upon the top of each.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tapioca Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Pour off as much stock as will suffice for the wants of
your family to-day. Strain, and heat it. Take off the
scum, and add a generous handful of tapioca, soaked two
hours in a little cold water. Simmer until clear.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Venison Pasty.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off slices of the least-done part of your roast venison;
divide into neat squares, season with pepper and
salt. Make a gravy by cooking bits of skin and refuse
pieces of meat in a little water; boiling the liquid down
one-half; cooling; taking off the top and seasoning well.
Cut the best parts of the tongue left from yesterday’s
soup very small. Put a layer of venison into a deep
dish; sprinkle with butter-bits rolled in flour, and cover
with the minced tongue. Upon this drop a few bits of
currant jelly. Fill the dish thus; pour on the gravy, and
put a thick crust of paste (kept over from Saturday’s pastry-making)
above all. Bake to a pale brown; wash over
with white of egg, and, when this hardens, with butter,
and shut the oven-door to glaze it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Empty a can of tomatoes into a saucepan. Cook
twenty-five minutes; season with sugar, pepper, salt, and
a tablespoonful of butter rolled in pounded cracker. Simmer
ten minutes longer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Kidney Beans au Maître d’Hôtel.</span></h3>

<p>Soak the beans all night. Boil soft in water, slightly
salt. Drain, and put hot into a saucepan with two tablespoonfuls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
of butter, a little parsley, chopped fine, pepper,
salt, and a little minced onion. Shake over the fire until
hissing hot, add the juice of half a lemon, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Cakes.</span></h3>

<p>Make the cold mashed potato left from yesterday into
flat, round cakes; flour abundantly; lay in a floured
baking-pan and set in a hot oven to brown. Serve upon
a hot flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Jelly.</span></h3>

<p>12 fine pippins; 2 cups of powdered sugar; juice of 2
lemons; grated peel of one; ½ package Coxe’s gelatine
soaked in 1 cup of cold water.</p>

<p>Pack the apples, when pared and cored, into a stoneware
or glass jar with a cup of cold water; put on the top
loosely to allow the escape of the steam; set in a pot of
warm water, heat slowly, and boil until the apples are very
soft. Have ready in a bowl the soaked gelatine, sugar,
lemon-juice and grated peel. Strain and squeeze the hot
apples over them; stir until the gelatine is dissolved,
strain again through a flannel bag. Wet a mould and
pour it in. This can be made on Saturday and kept
in a cold place.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit, Nuts, and Raisins.</span></h3>

<p>Put apples, pears, and oranges upon one dish; nuts
and raisins together.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Pea Soup.</span></h3>

<p>As your stock must be running low, add a quart of
boiling water to the contents of the jar, and boil slowly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
the back of the stove for an hour and a half. Strain, cool,
skim, and add a can of green peas. Cook until these
are tender; pulp through a colander into the soup, season
with pepper and salt, also a lump of white sugar, stir in a
lump of floured butter, and when it has boiled once
more, pour upon dice of fried bread placed in the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak.</span></h3>

<p>Flatten and broil upon a greased gridiron over a clear
fire. Turn as it drips. It should be done in ten or
twelve minutes. Lay upon a hot-water dish; pepper, salt,
and butter liberally. Cover with another hot dish, or a

<p>Pour the hot milk upon the soaked oatmeal, and stir
over the fire for fifteen minutes. Add the bread-crumbs,
beat up well; put in the onion, herbs, butter, pepper, and
salt, lastly the whipped eggs. When very light, butter a
mould, pour in the pudding, set in a pan of boiling water,
and this in a moderate oven. Bake one hour, turn out,
and send around a boat of drawn butter with it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Bake in a steady oven until soft; wipe, and send to
table without peeling them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Creamed Parsnips.</span></h3>

<p>Boil tender, scrape and slice lengthwise. Put over the

boils. Dish the parsnips, add to the sauce three tablespoonfuls
of cream in which has been stirred a quarterspoonful
of flour. Boil once, and pour over the parsnips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Plain Soup.</span></h3>

<p>5 lbs. shin of beef—meat sliced and bones cracked;
4 turnips; 4 carrots; 3 stalks of celery; 1 large onion
stuck with 6 cloves; bunch of herbs; pepper and salt;
6 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Put meat, bones and sliced vegetables on with the
water, and cook slowly four hours. At the end of two
hours take out a cupful of the meat, and spread out to
cool. When the four hours are up, strain the soup, rubbing
the vegetables through a colander; cool, skim, and season;
add the cooled meat cut into dice, heat to boiling,
and serve. Put the meat and bones left in the colander
into the stock-jar, with all of the soup not used to-day.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jugged Rabbits.</span></h3>

<p>Skin, clean with care, and joint the rabbits as for fricassee.
Lay thin slices of fat salt pork in the bottom of a
stoneware jar; lay upon them pieces of rabbits; strew
with minced onion and parsley; put in more pork and
more rabbit, etc. Add a cup of your soup or other gravy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
When all are in put on the cover of the jar, fitting closely,
and set in a pot of warm water. Tie a piece of thick
paper over the top of the jar to keep in the steam. Cook
steadily two hours—longer should you find, upon opening
the jar, that the meat is not tender. When it is done,
dish the meat, strain the gravy into a saucepan, and set
in cold water to throw up the fat. Take this off; add a
little currant jelly, browned flour, wet with water, and a
glass of claret. Boil one minute and pour over the meat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni with Cheese.</span></h3>

<p>Break half a pound of macaroni into short pieces, and
cook tender in hot salted water. When nearly done, stir
in a tablespoonful of butter. When tender, drain; stir
in two great spoonfuls of grated cheese, salt to taste, and
a little cayenne. Stir over the fire until the cheese is
melted; put in a spoonful of butter, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cauliflower.</span></h3>

<p>Boil the cauliflower in plenty of hot salted water. When
done, which should be in about twenty minutes, drain and
dish, the flower upward. Pour over it a cup of drawn
butter, seasoned with pepper, salt, and the juice of half a
lemon.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beets.</span></h3>

<p>Boil more than an hour, scrape and slice round. Dish,
and pour upon them a little butter heated with a like
quantity of vinegar, and seasoned with pepper and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rusk Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>12 stale rusks; 5 eggs; 4 tablespoonfuls of white sugar;
2 glasses of sherry.</p>

<p>Cut all the crust from the rusks and divide each into
two or three pieces of equal size. The slices should be an
inch thick. Pour the wine over them; let them lie in it
five minutes, then drain upon a sieve. Beat eggs and
sugar together. Lay the soaked rusks in these for a minute,
turning over and over, so as to coat them well. Fry
in boiling lard to a golden brown. Drain well and sprinkle
with powdered sugar mixed with cinnamon, and serve hot
with or without sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Celery Soup.</span></h3>

<p>12 stalks of celery; 3 pints of soup-stock; 1 cup of
milk; pepper and salt; 1 teaspoonful of sugar; ½ onion;
1 teaspoonful of flour wet up in cold milk.</p>

<p>Scrape and cut up the celery into inch lengths. Cook
fifteen minutes in a little hot water; drain and add three
pints of stock with the onion; stew gently until the celery
is very soft. Pulp through a colander into the soup;
season and return to the fire. Boil up; put in the sugar
and pour into the tureen. Add a cup of boiling milk
thickened with the flour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Beef’s Tongue with Sauce Piquante.</span></h3>

<p>Soak the tongue—a corned one—three hours; wash
well and cook in plenty of boiling water, fifteen minutes
per pound. Trim off the root; skin and dish, pouring
over it a cupful of rich drawn butter in which has been
stirred a great spoonful of capers, pickled nasturtium-seed,
or of green pickle chopped.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Soak a quart of navy or kidney-beans all night. In the
morning put on to boil in cold water, and cook soft.
Half an hour before taking them up, put in a piece of
streaked salt pork, three or four inches square. When
the beans are soft, drain; put into a bake-dish with the
pork half browned in the middle. Score the rind of the
parboiled pork; cover the dish, and bake one hour—then
brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Drain off most of the juice from a can of tomatoes
(Add to the tongue pot-liquor, by and by; boil together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>
ten minutes, and pour into the stock-jar.) Put the tomatoes
into a pudding-dish; season with pepper, salt, sugar,
and butter; strew fine crumbs over all; bake, covered,
half an hour, and brown quickly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chopped Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil potatoes, and let them get cold. Chop rather
coarsely; put into a saucepan, with a couple of spoonfuls
of butter, a little pepper and salt, and shake and stir until
very hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Puddings.</span></h3>

<p>6 butter crackers, soaked in water, and crushed to a
pulp; 3 lemons; half the grated peel; 1 cup of molasses;
1 tablespoonful melted butter; a pinch of salt; good pie-paste.</p>

<p>Pare away all the skin of the lemons, when you have
grated off half the yellow peel. Chop the pulp very fine,
and remove the seeds. Stir this into the crushed crackers
with the butter and salt. Beat in the molasses gradually,
then the lemon-peel. Have ready small paté-pans
lined with paste; fill with the mixture, and cook. Eat
cold, but fresh.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bread Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Save your crusts for several days for this soup. Break
about half a pound of them into small pieces, and lay in
an open oven to dry, while you skim your soup-stock;
add an onion, and put over the fire to boil. Cook gently
half an hour; strain; return to the kettle, and when it
boils again put in the crusts. Cook slowly twenty minutes,
stir, and beat the bread to a porridge, add seasoning
and a little minced parsley, and boil one minute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lobster Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p>1 can of preserved lobster; 2 eggs; 2 tablespoonfuls of
butter; ½ cup fine crumbs; yolks of two hard-boiled
eggs—pounded, then worked into the butter; juice of
half a lemon; salt, cayenne pepper, a pinch of mace, and
one of lemon-peel; beaten yolks of 2 raw eggs.</p>

<p>Mince the meat; work in the warmed butter and pounded
yolks, the seasoning, raw eggs—at last, the crumbs.
Make into oblong balls or rolls; roll in flour, and fry in
sweet lard. Drain upon clean paper, rolling each croquette
lightly upon it, and dish. Pass cream crackers and
sliced lemon with these excellent croquettes, and make a
separate course of them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Braised Grouse.</span></h3>

<p>Clean thoroughly, washing out the inside in soda and
water, and then rinsing and wiping. Truss, but do not
stuff the birds; tie them in shape. Cover the bottom of
a saucepan with slices of fat salt pork; lay the grouse
upon these; sprinkle minced onion and parsley over them
with pepper, salt, and a little sugar. Cover with more
pork, and pour in a large cupful of soup-stock, or other
broth. If you cannot spare this, put butter and water,
although it is not so good. Cover very closely; simmer
one hour; turn the birds, and cook—always covered—until
tender. Dish the grouse; strain the gravy; thicken
with browned flour; boil up, and pour into a boat.
Partridges, wild pigeons, and tough chickens may be
cooked in this way—also ducks.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Salsify Fritters.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, scrape, and grate the roots, letting them fall from
the grater into a batter made of two eggs, half a cup of
milk, flour enough for thin batter, and a little salt and
pepper. It should be like raw fritters when mixed. Drop,
by the spoonful, into the hot fat. As fast as they are fried
throw into a hot colander, set over a bowl in the oven.
Eat <i>hot</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>See Sunday of this week.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Indian Meal Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>4 beaten eggs; 1 quart of boiling milk; 2 scant cups
white “corn-flour,” or very fine meal; ½ cup of wheat
flour; 1 scant cup powdered sugar; 1 tablespoonful butter;
a little salt; 1 tablespoonful of cream of tartar, and
half as much soda sifted twice through the flour; ½ teaspoonful
mixed cinnamon and nutmeg.</p>

<p>Boil the milk; stir in the meal, flour, and salt. Boil
fifteen minutes, stirring up well from the bottom. Put
into a bowl, and beat hard for three minutes. When cold
add beaten eggs and sugar, with the spice. Whip long
and thoroughly. Bake in greased cups or muffin-tins, in
a steady oven. When done, turn out, and eat with butter
and powdered sugar.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Please refer to Wednesday, Third Week in March, for
a long and minute receipt for this soup. Make enough
for three days.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Mutton Chops.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of mutton chops; 5 fine potatoes; 1 onion; 1
kidney; 1 pint of oyster-liquor; pepper, salt, and parsley;
1 tablespoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Lay one-third of the chops—rid of all the fat and skin—in
a baking-dish; cover with potatoes and onions, sliced
very thin; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put on another
layer of chops, more potatoes and onions, then the sliced
kidney. Cover with potatoes; season; put in the rest of
the chops; cover with onion and potatoes. Pour in the
oyster-liquor and melted butter, with parsley, pepper, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
salt. Cover very closely, and bake in a moderate oven
three hours. Turn out upon a heated flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Break half a pound of macaroni into short pieces, and
boil twenty minutes in hot, salted water. Drain; add
two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, the minced remains
of yesterday’s game, or some other cold meat, a little
chopped ham, and four beaten eggs. Mix all well, wetting
with a little soup-stock—adding, finally, a cup of
milk, in which has been stirred a pinch of soda. Pour
into a greased mould, and boil one hour. Turn out, and
serve with a gravy made of cold gravy left from yesterday,
mixed with a little hot stock, strained, thickened, and
boiled for one minute.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Winter Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, cut up, and cook soft in boiling water, a little salt.
Drain; mash smooth, pressing out all the water; work in
butter, pepper, and salt, and mound in a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cold Slaw.</span></h3>

<p>Shred a firm cabbage, and pour over it a dressing made
in these proportions: One teaspoonful of sugar, half as
much salt, pepper, and made mustard, rubbed smooth in
two tablespoonfuls of oil, and then beaten up very gradually
with five tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and a teaspoonful
Colgate’s essence of celery.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cracker and Jam Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>3 eggs; ½ cup cracker-crumbs; ½ cup sugar; i tablespoonful
of butter; 1 cup of milk; ½ lemon—juice and
grated peel; 3 tablespoonfuls of jam.</p>

<p>Heat milk and crumbs together until scalding. Turn
out to cool, while you rub butter and sugar to a cream—adding
the lemon. Stir in the beaten yolks, the soaked
cracker and milk—at last, the whites. Butter a bake-dish;
put the jam at the bottom; fill up with the mixture, and
bake, covered, half an hour; then brown. Eat cold, with
sifted sugar on top. Or, if you like, you can put a
<i>méringue</i> over it before taking from the oven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">“That Soup” Again.</span></h3>

<p>Remove every particle of fat from the top of your stock.
Take out what is needed for to-day, and heat to boiling—slowly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Turkey, Garnished with Sausages.</span></h3>

<p>Wash out the turkey carefully. Stuff as usual, adding
a little cooked sausage to the dressing. (Salt the giblets,
and keep for to-morrow.) Lay the turkey in the dripping-pan,
pour a great cupful of boiling water over it, and roast
<i>about</i> ten minutes per pound—slowly for the first hour.
Baste faithfully and often, dredging with flour, and basting
with butter at the last. Dish the turkey, laying <i>boiled</i>
sausages around it. Pour the fat from the gravy; thicken
with browned flour; salt, and pepper. Boil once, and
serve in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, quarter, and cook tender in boiling water, a little
salt. Mash and press in a heated colander; work in
butter, pepper, and salt; heap smoothly in a deep dish,
and put “dabs” of pepper on top.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Corn Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>Drain, and chop the corn fine, add a tablespoonful of
melted butter, four beaten eggs; a large cup of milk,
with an even teaspoonful of corn-starch stirred in it, with
salt and pepper to taste. Bake, covered, in a greased pudding-dish
one hour; then brown quickly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>See Sunday of First Week in December.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cranberry Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Cook a quart of cranberries with a <i>very</i> little water,
slowly, in a porcelain or tinned saucepan. Stir often,
and when they are broken all to pieces, and thick as marmalade,
take off, sweeten liberally, and rub through a colander.
Wet a mould, and put them in to form.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Snow and Snowdrift Cake.</span></h3>

<p>4 large sweet oranges, juice of all, and grated peel of
one; juice and half the grated peel of 1 lemon; 1 package
of gelatine soaked in 1 cup of cold water; whites of
4 eggs, whipped stiff; 1 large cup of powdered sugar; 2
cups of boiling water.</p>

<p>Mix the juice and peel of the fruit with the soaked
gelatine, add the sugar, stir well, and leave them for one
hour. Pour on boiling water, and stir until clear. Strain,
and press through a coarse cloth. When cold, and beginning
to congeal, whip a spoonful at a time into the
frothed whites. Put into a wet mould. Do this of course
on Saturday.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Brown Giblet Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Cut each giblet into three pieces, and put on to boil in
stock made of the remnant of your mock turtle soup,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
diluted with water and strained. Simmer all together one
hour.</p>

<p>Chop the gizzard fine, pound the liver. Make what is
called technically a <i>roux</i>, by putting two tablespoonfuls of
butter into a saucepan, and when it bubbles, stirring in a
teaspoonful of browned flour, and continuing to stir until
they are well mixed and smooth. Add, spoonful by
spoonful, half a cup of boiling soup, then the pounded
liver; the gizzard, juice of half a lemon, and half a glass
of brown sherry. Stir all this into the soup, and boil up
once. Have in the tureen the yolks of four hard-boiled
eggs, each quartered with a keen knife, and pour the soup
upon them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Minced Turkey and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Cut all the meat from the skeleton of the turkey. Put
the bones, sinews, skin, and stuffing into a pot with three
quarts of cold water. Set at the back of the range and
let it simmer down to two quarts. Season, and set away
in your stock-pot.</p>

<p>Divide the meat intended for to-day into inch long
pieces, tearing rather than cutting it. Heat the skimmed
gravy; add as much drawn butter; two beaten eggs; pepper
and salt; put in the minced turkey; set back over the
fire, and stir until very hot. Cover the bottom of a
pudding-dish with fine crumbs; pour in the mixture;
strew crumbs on top, and bake to a light brown in a quick
oven. Serve in the bake-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Please see Thursday of last week—the First Week in
December. Add the surplus juice to your turkey-bone
“stock.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Pare and cut into small squares. Lay in cold water
half an hour; cook tender in hot water, a little salt.
When done—or nearly—pour this off, add a cup of cold
milk, and when this begins to simmer, a tablespoonful of
butter rolled in flour, pepper, salt, and a little minced
parsley. Boil gently one minute, and pour into a deep
dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Celery.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, scrape, and cut off the green leaves. Arrange
the best stalks in a celery-glass. Put two or three green
pieces into to-morrow’s soup-stock while boiling; and if
you have time cut up the rest into short bits, and put in a
jar or wide-mouthed bottle of vinegar to keep for salad-dressing.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Plain Rice Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 large cup of rice; 2 quarts of milk; 8 tablespoonfuls
of sugar; 1 teaspoonful of salt; 1 great spoonful of butter,
melted; nutmeg and cinnamon to taste.</p>

<p>Soak the rice two hours in a pint of the milk. Add,
then, the rest of the milk and the other ingredients.
Bake, covered, two hours; brown, and eat cold.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Simple White Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the top of your turkey soup-stock;
strain, rubbing the dressing through the colander. Simmer
one hour, with half a sliced onion and four tablespoonfuls
of soaked rice in it, or until the rice is soft. Be careful
that it does not scorch. Strain through the soup-sieve
into the tureen, add pepper and salt, if needed—finally a
cup of hot milk in which has been stirred and cooked for
one minute two beaten eggs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Fillet of Veal.</span></h3>

<p>Lard the fillet on top with strips of fat salt pork; lay a
few slices of corned ham in the bottom of a saucepan; on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
these the veal; cover with sliced ham; season with pepper,
salt, and a pinch of mace; pour in a cup of yesterday’s
soup, weakened with water. Cover closely and
stew two hours, turning the meat at the end of the first
hour; take up and keep the meat hot over boiling water;
add some browned flour and a tablespoonful of soaked gelatine
to the gravy when you have strained it, boil fast and
hard until it is thick, and of a glassy brown. Pour on the
veal, set in the oven, the larded side upward, and shut
the door for a few minutes to “glaze” it. Garnish with
light and dark green celery-tops. Lay the ham about it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spinach.</span></h3>

<p>Boil in plenty of hot salted water, for twenty-five minutes.
Drain, chop very fine, put back in the saucepan with
a teaspoonful of sugar, a little pepper, salt, and mace, and
a few spoonfuls of milk or cream. Beat and toss until it
is like a thick green custard, and pour out upon slices of
fried bread.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Soak all night. In the morning, put on in cold water,
and cook gently until soft. Drain, pepper and salt, and
pour over them, when dished, a little good drawn butter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare as usual—without browning.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Queen’s Toast.</span></h3>

<p>Cut thick slices of stale baker’s bread into rounds with
a cake-cutter and fry to a nice brown in hot lard. Dip
each slice into boiling water to remove the grease;
sprinkle with a mixture of powdered sugar and cinnamon,
and pile one upon the other. Serve a sauce made of
powdered sugar, dissolved in the strained juice of a lemon
and thinned with a glass of wine. Put a very little upon
each round. Butter sauces are too rich for queen’s toast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beef Gravy Soup.</span></h3>

<p>4 lbs. of coarse lean beef; 3 lbs. of bones; 2 sliced
onions; 2 turnips; 2 carrots; bunch of sweet herbs; 3 stalks
of celery; pepper and salt; 1 tablespoonful corn-starch,
wet up in cold water; 5 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Cut the beef in small strips and fry to a good brown,
in plenty of dripping. Take out the meat and lightly fry
the bones. Remove these and put with the meat into the
soup-pot. Now fry in the same fat the sliced onions;
add these, when brown, to the meat and bones, and pour
on them the five quarts of water. Cook slowly one hour;
take off the scum, and put in the sliced carrots, turnips,
the celery and herbs. Boil gently four hours. Strain;
pick out the meat and bones, and put, well-seasoned, into
the stock-jar. Pulp the vegetables into the soup; season;
pour all but two quarts into the stock-jar, and set aside.
Cool that left out for to-day, skim and re-heat; add the
corn-starch, boil up and serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cannelon of Veal, Oysters, and Sweetbreads.</span></h3>

<p>Chop the remains of your stewed fillet; boil, blanch, and
cool two sweetbreads, and mince <i>very</i> fine. Chop, also,
twelve oysters. Mix all these together with a cup of fine
bread-crumbs; add plenty of seasoning and two beaten
eggs. Work to a paste; flour your hands and make into
a roll seven or eight inches long, and three or four inches
in diameter. Envelope this in a crust of good pie-paste,
closing the open ends with rounds of paste. Lay in a
floured baking-pan, the joined edges downward, and bake
in a steady oven. Just before taking it up glaze with
butter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes Sautés.</span></h3>

<p>Boil and slice while hot. Put into a frying-pan with a
large spoonful of butter, pepper, salt, and powdered parsley.
Stir constantly until very hot, and dish. They
must not be at all brown or even dry. Serve very hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Succotash.</span></h3>

<p>Empty a can of succotash into a saucepan; cover with
boiling water, a little salt, and cook half an hour. Turn
off the water; pour in a cup of milk, and when this boils,
stir in a tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour; season
with pepper and salt; boil once, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cranberry Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>If you have none ready made, prepare according to receipt
given for Sunday of this week. It is well to make
a good supply at a time, since it keeps well in cold
weather.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Impromptu Plum Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups of made mince-meat—“Atmore’s” is very good;
1½ cups prepared flour; 6 beaten eggs.</p>

<p>Whip the yolks and stir (with additional sugar, if
needed,) into the mince-meat. Beat hard for two or
three minutes. Put in whisked whites and the flour
alternately. Butter a large mould; put in the mixture,
leaving room for the swelling of the pudding, and boil,
without the intermission of a moment, for five hours.
Turn out upon a hot dish; pour brandy over it, and light
just as it goes into the dining-room. Eat with rich sauce.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Skim the fat from your soup-stock, and put it, meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
bones and all, over the fire with a can of tomatoes. Simmer
one hour and strain, rubbing the tomatoes through
the colander. Season to taste; return to the fire, and
when it boils, put in a lump of sugar, and a tablespoonful
of butter cut up in half as much flour. Boil up once.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Glazed Ham.</span></h3>

<p>Put into cold water about ten o’clock on Wednesday
night, and let it soak until the fire is made next morning.
Put on then in plenty of cold water, and cook eighteen or
twenty minutes per pound. Set out of doors when done,
in a large, shallow pan, and cover with the pot-liquor.
You should have made, meanwhile, the “glaze,” by boiling
down a cup of yesterday’s soup, with an equal quantity
of strained pot-liquor, until the result was a thick
brown broth. Add a tablespoonful of soaked gelatine,
and set the mixture in boiling water. When the ham is
nearly, or quite cold, skim carefully; wash all over with
the glaze, and set in the oven to harden. If not quite
thick enough, apply a second coat when the first is dry.
Twist frilled paper about the shank.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Puff.</span></h3>

<p>Whip hot boiled potatoes light and soft with milk, butter,
and salt. Beat in two whisked eggs, and heap irregularly
within a buttered bake-dish. Brown quickly, and
serve in the dish in which it was baked.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chopped Cabbage with Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Quarter a cabbage, and boil tender in hot salted water.
Chop when you have drained it; season with pepper and
salt. Drain again, pressing out the water; put into a hot
dish and pour over it a cup of drawn butter, having for
a base some of the strained ham-liquor, into which have
been stirred a tablespoonful of celery vinegar and a little
made mustard. Send up hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Celery Salad.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape and cut into short pieces. Put into a salad-bowl,
and pour over it a dressing such as was made for
cold-slaw on Saturday, First Week in December.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Corn-Starch Cup-Cake.</span></h3>

<p>5 eggs; 1 cup of butter; 2 cups of sugar; 1 cup sweet
milk; 1 cup of corn-starch; 2 cups of prepared flour;
vanilla flavoring.</p>

<p>Cream butter and sugar; beat in the yolks, the milk,
the corn-starch and flour mixed together, alternately with
the whites—lastly, the vanilla. Bake in small loaves, and
eat while fresh. Pass hot chocolate with them.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 quarts of oysters; 1 quart of milk; 2 tablespoonfuls
of butter; 1 teacupful hot water; pepper, salt and a blade
of mace.</p>

<p>Strain all the liquor from the oysters; add the water,
and heat. When near the boil, add the seasoning, then,
the oysters. Cook about five minutes from the time they
begin to simmer, until they “ruffle.” Stir in the butter,
cook one minute and pour into the tureen. Stir in the
boiling milk, and send to table.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Chickens.</span></h3>

<p>Clean and truss the chickens, but do not stuff them.
Sew up each in a piece of mosquito-netting, and boil in
plenty of hot salted water. Allow about twelve minutes
to the pound. Undo the netting; wipe the chickens, and
rub all over with butter. Send up in a boat a cup of
melted butter in which have been stirred the pounded
yolks of two hard boiled eggs, and some powdered or
minced parsley. Pour a few spoonfuls over the chickens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Browned Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil with their skins on. Throw off the water; take
each potato in a clean towel, and hold it while you strip
off the skin. Lay them, when peeled, in a greased baking-pan,
and set this in a hot oven. Roast, with good dripping,
until they are well colored.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Wash, and bake soft in a moderate oven. Serve in
their “jackets.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Squash.</span></h3>

<p>Pare, slice, and mash. Stir in, while it is hot, a good
spoonful of butter, pepper and salt to taste, and two
beaten eggs. Pour into a buttered dish; strew fine
crumbs on the top, and bake, covered, half an hour—then
brown slightly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Custards.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 4 beaten eggs; 5 tablespoonfuls of
sugar, beaten with the eggs; nutmeg, and 2 teaspoonfuls
of flavoring extract.</p>

<p>Scald the milk; pour upon the other ingredients; stir
together well; flavor, and pour into stone-china cups.
Set these in a pan of hot water; grate nutmeg upon each,
and bake until firm. Eat cold from the cups.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken and Sago Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the top from your chicken pot-liquor; add the
cracked bones of the chickens, from which you cut the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
meat for “breakfast, luncheon, <i>or</i> tea;” boil gently one
hour. Strain, and season to taste; add a cup of soaked
sago, and simmer until it is soft and clear.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beefsteak Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of rump steak; 3 eggs; 2 cups of milk; 5 tablespoonfuls
of prepared flour; pepper and salt; melted
butter; parsley; French mustard.</p>

<p>Cut the steaks into pieces rather more than an inch wide
and long. Beat with a rolling-pin; pepper and salt, and
dip each in a mixture of melted butter and minced parsley,
with a little French mustard. Lay in the bottom of
a greased bake-dish; pour over them a batter made of
the eggs, flour, and milk, bake an hour and a quarter.
Serve in the bake-dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Onions.</span></h3>

<p>Cook and boil in salted water fifteen minutes; throw
this off, and cover with milk and water. Cook tender;
drain; pepper and salt, and pour in a cupful of drawn
butter. Simmer five minutes, and turn out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Prepare in the usual manner, taking care not to get
them too stiff.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Hominy.</span></h3>

<p>Boil hominy—the fine-grained—the day before you want
to use it. When perfectly cold and stiff, remove the skin
from the top, and cut the hominy into neat squares. Flour
and salt these, and fry to a nice brown in hot lard or
dripping. Drain well, and eat hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Potato Pie.</span></h3>

<p>Parboil; skin; cool, and slice crosswise firm sweet
potatoes. Line a pie-dish with a good crust; put in a
layer of sliced potatoes; sprinkle abundantly with sugar;
scatter in four or five whole cloves, and cover with more
slices. Fill the dish thus: put in a liberal tablespoonful
of melted butter; pour in a little water and a teaspoonful
of lemon-juice; cover with puff-paste, and bake. Eat
cold. This is a Virginia dish, and very nice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ox-tail Soup.</span></h3>

<p>2 ox-tails; 1 onion; 2 turnips; 2 carrots; bunch of
sweet herbs; 6 whole cloves; 2 tablespoonfuls of catsup;
1 glass of wine; pepper and salt; ½ lb. of lean ham; butter;
water.</p>

<p>Joint the tails, and slice the vegetables and ham. Put
two tablespoonfuls of butter into the soup kettle, with the
tails, ham, vegetables, herbs, and a pint of water. Cover
closely, and simmer half an hour after they begin to smoke.
Add, then, six quarts of water, if the tails are of a fair
size, and simmer four hours, or until the vegetables are
boiled to pieces and the tails very tender. Do this on
Saturday; season the soup, and turn all into the stock-jar.
On Sunday take off the fat, and strain the soup,
pulping the vegetables, and taking out the pieces of tail.
Put these into the stock-jar, with all the soup you do not
need for to-day; also the bits of ham. Heat the portion
left out for to-day; stir in a good spoonful of browned
flour wet in water, the catsup and wine, and boil up fairly
before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ducks à la Mode.</span></h3>

<p>Joint the ducks; pepper, salt, and flour them. Fry to
a light brown in a little butter. Put into a saucepan with
a cup of your soup-stock—strained off before pulping the
vegetables—a tablespoonful of minced onion, pepper and
salt to taste. Cover, and stew tender; say about forty
minutes from the commencement of the boil. Keep hot
over boiling water while you strain the gravy; add a glass
of wine, and thicken with browned flour. Boil until thick,
and pour over the ducks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned Green Peas.</span></h3>

<p>Drain, cover with boiling water, and cook tender.
Pour off the water; dish, and stir in a little hot butter,
mixed with pepper, salt, and a dust of powdered sugar.
Toss and mix well, and serve hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Turnips.</span></h3>

<p>See Sunday, Second Week in December.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Cauliflower.</span></h3>

<p>Boil twenty minutes—tied up in netting—in hot salted
water. Cut into small clusters, rejecting the main stalk
altogether. Set these closely together in a buttered bake-dish;
pour drawn butter over them, and sift fine crumbs
thickly upon the top. Bake in a good oven until browned.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sponge-Cake Soufflé Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>12 square (penny) stale sponge-cakes; 5 eggs; 1 cup
of milk; 2 glasses of sherry; ½ cup of sugar.</p>

<p>Lay the cakes in a buttered pudding-dish; pour the
wine over them, and cover for half an hour. Heat the
milk; pour upon the beaten yolks and half the sugar.
Stir over the fire until quite thick. Pour, gradually, upon
the cakes, letting it soak in well before adding more.
Put into the oven, and, when very hot, cover with the
whites, whisked stiff with the rest of the sugar, and shut
the oven-door until the <i>méringue</i> is colored. Make on
Saturday, and eat cold on Sunday.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Second Edition Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Strain off the soup from the meat in your stock-jar;
heat slowly to a boil; put in a cupful of the best parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>
the meat, cut neatly from the joints, and divided into
square bits. Boil one minute, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boiled Corned Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Put a piece of brisket, weighing six or eight pounds, in
plenty of cold water. Set at the back of the range out of
everybody’s way, and cook slowly, allowing eighteen minutes
per pound. Take up; wipe carefully; rub all over
with butter, and dish. Serve horseradish sauce with it.
Pour the pot-liquor into the stock-jar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Select those of uniform size, and roast in a moderate
oven until soft. Wipe, and wrap in a napkin, spread
upon a flat dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scalloped Cabbage.</span></h3>

<p>When your beef has begun to boil fairly, put in a firm
white cabbage, from which you have stripped the outer
leaves. Cook in the boiling pot-liquor until tender.
Take out, quarter, and let it cool rapidly. When quite
cold, chop; stir in pepper and salt, and put into a greased
bake-dish. Pour over it half a cupful of soup-stock; sift
crumbs thickly on the top, and bake, covered, half an
hour, or until very hot throughout; then brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Horseradish Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Stir two tablespoonfuls of grated horseradish and a
tablespoonful of vinegar into a cup of drawn butter until
it is like white cream. If the horseradish be put up in
vinegar, omit the tablespoonful of that condiment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Farina Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart new milk; 4 tablespoonfuls of farina; 4 eggs;
5 tablespoonfuls of sugar; nutmeg.</p>

<p>Soak the farina two hours in a little water. Scald the
milk; stir in the farina, and cook ten minutes, using the
spoon constantly. Pour upon the beaten eggs and sugar.
Beat all together well. Put in nutmeg to taste, and pour
into a buttered pudding-dish. Bake half an hour, or until
firm and well colored. Eat warm—not hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Split Pea Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Soak a quart of split peas overnight. Next day, put
on in the pot-liquor from your corned beef—having removed
the fat from the latter. Add an onion, sliced, and
three stalks of celery, with a few sprigs of parsley, cut fine.
Boil gently—adding boiling water should the liquid sink
too much—three hours. Rub through a colander; return
to the fire; pepper, and stir in a cup of milk, in which has
been cooked for one minute a tablespoonful of butter, cut
up in a teaspoonful of flour. Pour out at once upon dice
of fried bread laid in the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Mutton Chops.</span></h3>

<p>Cut off the skin and fat. Lard the chops thickly with
strips of fat pork. Season them with a mixture of pepper,
salt, and mace. Put into a saucepan; cover with a little
of yesterday’s soup, if you have no other gravy, and a
spoonful of tomato catsup. If you have a spoonful or two
of green peas left from Sunday, put them in, and a little
minced onion. Cover, and cook slowly half an hour.
Turn the chops, and cook twenty minutes longer. Take
out, and keep warm. Strain the gravy; thicken with
browned flour and a tablespoonful of chopped cucumber
pickle; boil two minutes. Put in the chops, and simmer
three minutes. Arrange the chops upon a hot dish, and
cover with the gravy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tomato Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>Stew a can of tomatoes twenty minutes. Pulp through
a colander, and put back into the saucepan, with pepper,
salt, sugar, and a great spoonful of butter rolled in flour.
Simmer twenty minutes more, or until the sauce is of the
consistency of boiled custard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lima Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Soak the dried beans all night. Next day, cook soft,
putting them on in cold water, and boiling slowly.
Drain; season with pepper, salt, and butter, and dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Macaroni à la Crême.</span></h3>

<p>Cook—having broken it into short pieces—half a pound
of macaroni ten minutes in boiling water. Pour this off,
and add a cupful of milk, with a little salt. Stew tender
in this. In another saucepan heat a cup of milk, thicken
with a teaspoonful of flour, stir in a tablespoonful of butter,
and, at last, a beaten egg. Drain the macaroni;
dish; stir through it two heaping tablespoonfuls of grated
cheese, with a little cayenne. Pour on the sauce, and
serve.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple and Tapioca Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 teacupful tapioca; 6 pippins, pared and cored; 1
quart of water; 1 teaspoonful of salt; a little grated
lemon-peel; sugar; cloves.</p>

<p>Cover the tapioca with three cups of tepid water, and
set in a warm place for five hours, stirring once in a while.
Pack the apples in a pudding-dish, with a pinch of lemon-peel
in each. Add a cup of warm water; cover closely,
and cook in a moderate oven, turning as they cook at the
bottom. When soft, drain off the water, fill the centre of
each apple with sugar, put a clove in each, and pour over
them the tapioca. Cover, and bake one hour. Eat
warm, with hard sauce.</p>

Stewed Celery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Potatoes à la Lyonnaise.<br />
——<br />
Cottage Pudding.<br />
——<br />
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rabbit Soup.</span></h3>

<p>1 large rabbit; 2 lbs. of beef-bones; 2 slices lean
corned ham; 1 large onion; bunch of sweet herbs; 2<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span>
tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce; 3 quarts of water; raw
egg; crumbs.</p>

<p>Put the rabbit, jointed, the cracked bones, sliced ham
and onion, and chopped herbs on in the water. Fit a
tight cover upon the pot; set a weight on top, and stew
four hours. The meat should be in rags. Strain, rubbing
the vegetables through the colander. Season, cool, and
take off the fat. Put over the fire, add some tomato
sauce left from yesterday, boil up, and pour out. Chop
a little of the soup-meat fine while the soup is cooling;
season; work in some fine crumbs and a beaten egg.
Make into balls, flour well, and fry in dripping. Put
these into the tureen before the soup goes in.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Venison Steaks.</span></h3>

<p>Trim off the hard skin, and flatten each steak with the
side of a hatchet. Butter the gridiron well, and have the
fire clear and hot. Turn often, not to lose a drop of the
juice. Cook three or four minutes longer than you would
beefsteaks. The Vertical Broiler is admirably adapted
for broiling venison. Have ready, in a hot chafing-dish,
a tablespoonful of butter for each pound of venison, a
pinch of salt, a little pepper, a tablespoonful of currant
jelly for each pound, and a glass of wine for every four
pounds. This should be warmed by the hot water
beneath the dish, by the time the venison is laid in it.
Turn the steaks twice in it; cover; put fresh boiling
water below, or light the lamp, and let it stand five minutes
before serving.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Oyster Salad.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of oysters—cut, not chopped, to pieces; 1
bunch of celery, also cut small; 2 tablespoonfuls best
salad oil; 1 teaspoonful of powdered sugar; ½ teaspoonful
of salt, and the same of pepper and of made mustard;
yolks of 2 raw eggs; 4 tablespoonfuls cider vinegar.</p>

<p>Beat the yolks light, with sugar, salt, pepper, and mustard.
Whip in, gradually, the oil until the mixture is
thick; add the vinegar—beating still—a little at a time.
Put the oysters, drained and cut up, with the celery, into
a salad-dish; pour over them the dressing; stir in well;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span>
garnish with a fringe of delicate celery-tops, and serve as
soon as possible.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Celery.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape, and cut the stalks into rather short pieces.
Cook tender in boiling salted water; drain this off, and
add a cupful of drawn butter, well seasoned. Simmer in
this five minutes, and pour into a deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potatoes à la Lyonnaise.</span></h3>

<p>12 parboiled and cold potatoes; 1 chopped onion;
chopped parsley, pepper, and salt; butter, or dripping,
for frying.</p>

<p>Slice, or chop the potatoes. Heat the dripping in a
frying-pan. Put in the onion, and fry one minute; then
cook the potatoes, adding the parsley and seasoning.
Shake and stir constantly lest the potatoes should stick to
the pan, or brown. They should be done in five minutes.
Drain off the fat by shaking to and fro in a hot colander—then
dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cottage Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup of sugar; 1 tablespoonfuls of butter, creamed with
the sugar; 2 eggs; 1 cup of milk; 3 cups of prepared
flour; 1 teaspoonful—scant—of salt.</p>

<p>Rub butter and sugar together; beat up with the yolks;
add the milk, the whipped whites—lastly, the flour. Bake
in a buttered cake-mould. Turn out, when done, upon a
hot plate. In serving, cut in slices, and eat with liquid
sauce.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Vermicelli Soup.</span></h3>

<p>4 lbs. knuckle of veal; 1 lb. lean ham; 2 carrots; 1
onion; 4 stalks of celery; bunch of herbs; 1 great spoonful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span>
of butter; 6 quarts of water; 4 tablespoonfuls of vermicelli,
broken small, and boiled ten minutes in hot salted
water.</p>

<p>Cut up the veal and ham into small pieces; slice the
vegetables; put into a soup-pot in which you have melted
a great spoonful of butter. Set where it will heat slowly;
cover closely, and leave it for one hour, stirring now and
then. Pour in, then, the cold water, and cook gently
four hours. Drain off the liquid, pick out meat and
bones, and put into the stock-jar; pour on all the soup
not wanted for to-day’s use, season, and set away. Pulp
the vegetables into to-day’s soup; season; cool, and remove
the fat. Put over the fire, and boil and skim five
minutes. Add the vermicelli—simmer one minute, and
pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Veal Cutlets à la Milanaise.</span></h3>

<p>Make your butcher cut the cutlets very thin—about
half the thickness of those usually sold. Flatten with the
side of a hatchet; dip in beaten yolk of egg, then in
cracker-dust, mixed with pepper and salt. Fry to a fine
brown in hot dripping. Drain off the fat; lay upon a hot
dish, and put upon the middle of each slice (they should
not be more than four inches long by three wide) a spoonful
of the following sauce: Make a half-cup of drawn butter;
stir in the stiffened white of an egg, with a tablespoonful
of chopped parsley, and the juice of half a lemon.
Beat light with your egg-whisk; heat very hot, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Soak white beans all night. Put them on in the morning
in cold water, and cook soft. Drain, and pour over
them some nice gravy—soup-stock, if you have no other;
add a little finely-minced onion, and simmer ten minutes.
Turn out without draining.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hominy Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>1 cupful of cold boiled hominy (the small-grained); 2
cups of milk; 1 heaping teaspoonful of butter-warmed;
1 teaspoonful of sugar; 3 eggs; a little salt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span></p>

<p>Mix all together in a smooth batter, and bake in a buttered
pudding-dish. Eat hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hot Slaw.</span></h3>

<p>Boil the cabbage in two waters. Drain, when tender;
chop quickly, press out all the water, and put into a deep
dish. Heat in a saucepan half a cup of vinegar, one
tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of sugar, pepper
and salt at discretion. When scalding, add a half
teaspoonful of flour wet with water. Boil one minute, and
pour upon the cabbage. If you have celery vinegar at
hand, use for this dressing.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Corn and Tomato Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Take the fat from the top of your stock. Drain off the
soup, and add a can of corn, chopped fine, and the same
of tomatoes, rubbed through a colander. Cook all slowly
one hour; add what seasoning is required, and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Halibut.</span></h3>

<p>Get a cut of halibut weighing five or six pounds, and lay
for two hours in salt and water. Wipe dry, and score the
outer skin. Set in the baking-pan; pour a cupful of boiling
water, in which has been mixed a tablespoonful of
butter, over it, and bake one hour, basting often with butter-and-water.
When a fork will penetrate it easily, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
done. Lay upon a hot dish; add a little boiling water to
the gravy, stir in a teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, the juice
of half a lemon, and a little browned flour, wet up with
cold water. Serve in a boat when you have boiled it one
minute.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Pigeons.</span></h3>

<p>Clean the pigeons, tie them in shape, and cook precisely
as you did the grouse on Friday, First Week in
December.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Serve with the halibut.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Salsify.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape, and boil until tender. Drain and cool. Mash
to a paste, picking out the fibres. Add a very little milk,
a spoonful of butter and a beaten egg and a half for each
cupful of mashed salsify. Make into flat, round cakes;
roll in flour, and fry brown.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dorchester Cracker Plum-Pudding.</span></h3>

<p>2 quarts of milk; 6 Boston crackers, split and buttered;
8 eggs, beaten very light; 2 cups of sugar; nutmeg,
cloves, and cinnamon to taste; 1 lb. of raisins, seeded
and cut in two; 1 teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Heat the milk almost to boiling, and pour upon the
beaten eggs and sugar, with the seasoning. Do not boil
it again. Butter a pudding-dish; put a layer of buttered
crackers in the bottom, buttered side up, and moisten
with a few spoonfuls of custard. Cover thickly with
raisins, and these with crackers, buttered side downward.
Moisten with hot custard, and repeat the order given,
until crackers and fruit are all in the dish. Pour in custard
until only the surface of the upper layer is visible,
but not enough to float them. Cover, and leave all night
in a cold place. Add the rest of the custard in the morning,
at intervals of five or six minutes between the cupfuls.
Bake, covered, two hours in a moderate oven; then
brown. Eat hot, with sauce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sheep’s Head and Barley Soup.</span></h3>

<p>1 sheep’s head, <i>carefully</i> cleaned, with the skin on; 4
pig’s feet, also cleaned nicely; 2 onions; 2 turnips; 2
carrots; bunch of sweet herbs; 1 can of tomatoes; ½
cup of soup-barley, soaked two hours in a little water;
7 quarts of water; pepper, salt, mace, and sugar.</p>

<p>Crack the bones of the head and feet; wash very well;
put the sliced vegetables and the herbs into a pot with
the water, and cook gently five hours. At the end of
three hours add the tomatoes. Should the liquid boil
down to less than five quarts by the time you are ready to
add the tomatoes, replenish from the tea-kettle. When
the five hours are up, strain off the soup. Put bones and
meat into the stock-jar, and add all the clear soup you do
not want to-day. Season, and set aside. Now pulp the
vegetables into the soup left out for Saturday’s dinner,
season, cool, and skim off the fat. Return to the fire
with the barley, and simmer half an hour.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bacon and Eggs.</span></h3>

<p>Cut one pound of streaked bacon into thin long slices;
put into a frying-pan and cook slowly, turning often, until
quite crisp. Pour off and strain the fat, and pour two
tablespoonfuls of it into a stone-china or block-tin dish.
Add two larger spoonfuls of good gravy left from yesterday’s
pigeons, with as much cream, in which have been
mixed half a teaspoonful of flour and a pinch of soda. Set
this in a dripping-pan, with boiling water in the bottom,
but not enough to overflow the dish, and stir upon the
top of the range until quite hot. Then break upon it seven
or eight, or more eggs, and put into a quick oven to “set.”
When firm, send to table with the bacon laid about them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cheese Fondu.</span></h3>

<p>1 cup dry and fine bread-crumbs; 2 scant cups of milk,
with a pinch of soda stirred in; ½ lb. dry cheese, grated;
3 beaten eggs; 1 small tablespoonful of melted butter;
pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Soak the crumbs in the milk; beat in eggs, butter, seasoning—finally
the cheese. Butter a pudding-dish; pour
in the mixture, strew crumbs on the top, and bake in a
rather quick oven to a light brown. Serve at once, as it
soon falls.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Canned String-Beans.</span></h3>

<p>Cut into short lengths; cover with hot, salted water, and
cook forty minutes. Drain; dish, and stir in pepper, salt,
and butter.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lemon Tartlets.</span></h3>

<p>5 eggs; 5 tablespoonfuls of sugar; 1 quart of milk; ⅓
cup of prepared flour; 1 lemon, a large one—juice and
grated peel; a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>Heat the milk; stir in the flour wet with a little cold
milk, and heat again, stirring all the while. Pour upon
the beaten yolks and sugar; cook for one minute. Take
from the fire, and beat in the lemon-juice and grated rind.
Have ready, baked and hot, some shells of puff-paste
lining “patty-pans.” Fill with the mixture and cover
each with a <i>méringue</i> made of the whipped whites and a
little powdered sugar. Put into the oven to set, and lightly
color the <i>méringue</i>. Eat fresh, but not hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clear Sago Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Remove the fat from your soup-jelly. Pour off as
much as you need for to-day, without disturbing the sediment.
Heat, simmer and skim until the scum ceases to
rise; put in half a cup of German sago which has been
soaking one hour in a little water. Cook gently until
clear.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Lay in a dripping-pan and pour a cup of boiling water
over it. Roast about ten minutes per pound, basting
frequently and copiously. When done, dish; pour the
strained gravy into a bowl and set in ice-water to throw
up the fat. Remove this, return the gravy to the fire,
pepper, salt, and thicken with browned flour. Boil once,
and serve in a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Potato Balls.</span></h3>

<p>Mash potatoes very light with butter, milk and salt, and
beat in two raw eggs. Put into a buttered saucepan,
and stir until hot and stiff. Turn out and let the paste
get cold. Then make into balls; roll each in flour; half
an hour before taking up the roast beef, pour off nearly
all the gravy, and lay the balls about the meat in the
dripping-pan. Baste them whenever you baste the meat,
and cook to a fine brown. Drain off the grease, and serve
as a garnish to the beef, when dished.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fried Sweet Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, peel, and let them get cold. Then slice lengthwise;
pepper, salt, flour, and fry quickly in good dripping.
Drain well and serve hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Apple Sauce.</span></h3>

<p>See Wednesday, Second Week in November.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Celery.</span></h3>

<p>See Monday Second Week in December.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ribbon Blanc-Mange.</span></h3>

<p>1 quart of milk; 1 package Cooper’s gelatine; ¾ cup
of sugar; 1 great spoonful of grated chocolate, wet in
a very little cold milk; beaten yolk of one egg; 1 great
spoonful of cranberry juice; vanilla extract.</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine one hour in a cup of the milk. Heat
the rest to scalding; add sugar and soaked gelatine, and
stir eight minutes over the fire. Strain through a muslin
bag into four bowls, putting equal portions in all. Color
one brown by stirring in the wet chocolate; another yellow,
by beating in the yolk; a third, pink with cranberry
juice, or currant jelly. Leave the fourth white. Return
each portion, excepting this last, to the fire in its turn, and
stir until very hot. When all are cold and beginning to
congeal, wet a mould, and pour in, first, half of the white;
next, half of the pink; thirdly, half of the yellow;
fourthly, half of the brown. Upon this brown empty the
rest of the white, and let the pink, yellow, and brown follow
in course. Let each of the eight courses get firm
enough to bear the next before adding more. Do all this
on Saturday. On Sunday, turn out and pass with light
cake, followed by coffee. The vanilla extract is intended
for the chocolate only.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful dish, easy and safe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cream Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Put the contents of your stock-pot over the fire; add
as much boiling water as is needed to make soup for to-day.
First, however, take out the sheep’s tongue, and
lay it aside. Simmer the soup for one hour; strain and
season; return to the fire, and when it is hot, add a tablespoonful
of butter rolled in flour; next, the sheep’s
tongue, skinned and cut into dice. Boil up; pour into
the tureen, and stir in a cup of hot milk in which two
beaten eggs have been cooked one minute.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larded Beef.</span></h3>

<p>Thrust lardoons of fat salt pork quite through your
cold roast, when you have trimmed off the ragged parts.
Put into a deep pan; strew with chopped herbs, and
minced onion, pepper, salt, and four or five whole cloves;
also, a tablespoonful of chopped green pickle. Half
cover with broth made from yesterday’s skimmed gravy,
and a little soup-stock. Cover the pan closely, set in a
moderate oven, and cook one hour—more, if the piece
be large. Turn, when the time is half gone. Dish the
meat, strain, and thicken the gravy. Give it one boil;
pour a little upon the meat, the rest into a boat.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mashed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Mash, or whip up light with milk, butter and salt, and
heap roughly upon a hot dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Tomatoes.</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Baked Soup.</span></h3>

<p>3 lbs. of beef, cut into small squares; ½ lb. lean ham,
chopped; 1 lb. of veal, cut small; 2 onions; 2 carrots;
2 tablespoonfuls German sago; can of green peas; pepper
and salt; 6 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Put the chopped ham in the bottom of a broad jar that
will go into your oven; cover with sliced vegetables,
some of the peas and sago, and this with beef or veal.
Pack vegetables and meat in alternate layers, seasoning
each with pepper and salt. Pour in six quarts of water,
if the jar will hold so much; fit on a close cover; spread
a paste of flour and water around the edge to keep in the
steam; set in a dripping-pan of hot water, and leave in a
moderate oven six hours, replenishing the water in the
pan, now and then. Dip out as much soup—just as it
comes—as you want for to-day, at the end of this time;
let it cool sufficiently to enable you to take off the fat;
heat in a saucepan just to the boiling point, and pour into
the tureen. Add a quart of boiling water and a little
salt to the contents of the jar; cover, while hot, and set
away in a cold place, as stock—and excellent stock it
will be.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mock Pigeons.</span></h3>

<p>2 large cutlets of veal, cut rather thin, and beaten flat;
½ lb. of fat salt pork; yolks of two hard-boiled eggs; 1<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
cup of bread-crumbs; pepper, salt, and 1 tablespoonful
of chopped onion pickle; a little sugar; powdered or
minced parsley; a little oyster-liquor.</p>

<p>Lay the cutlets upon a dish, and spread the upper side
with a force-meat made of the ingredients above enumerated;
roll each up closely; bind in shape with soft string,
and lay in a dripping-pan. Pour over them two cupfuls
of boiling water, in which have been mixed two tablespoonfuls
of butter, and the surplus tomato-juice saved from
yesterday’s can of tomatoes. Cover with another pan of
the same size—inverted—and set in a steady oven. Bake
a little over an hour—half an hour more, should the
“pigeons” be large. Take them up when tender, and
brown, clip, and withdraw the strings, and keep hot while
you strain, season, and thicken the gravy. Boil one minute,
and pour into a boat.</p>

<p>See Thursday, Second Week in December.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Corn.</span></h3>

<p>Empty a can of corn into a saucepan; cover with boiling
salted water, and stew half an hour. Drain off the
water, and cover the corn with a cupful of drawn butter,
well seasoned. Simmer, stirring often, fifteen minutes,
and pour out.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Arrowroot Pudding—Hot.</span></h3>

<p>3 even tablespoonfuls arrowroot; 1 quart fresh milk;
1 tablespoonful of butter; 4 tablespoonfuls of sugar; 4
eggs, beaten light; nutmeg and vanilla flavoring.</p>

<p>Scald the milk; wet the arrowroot with cold water, and
stir into the hot milk, until the latter is well thickened.
Cream the butter and sugar; beat up very light with the
eggs, and stir into the thickened milk. Flavor; pour into
a buttered mould; set in a pot of boiling water—not deep
enough to float it—and boil steadily for one hour. Set
in cold water one minute, and turn out upon a hot dish.
Eat with brandy or wine sauce. It is very nice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sweetbread Ball Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, blanch, cool, and chop very fine two sweetbreads;
mix with them one-third their bulk of fine crumbs, previously
soaked, and rubbed smooth with a little cream. Beat up
the yolk of a raw egg, and work all with pepper and salt to
a paste. Make into small balls with floured hands, and
set by for half an hour in a cold place. Strain off two
quarts of soup from your stock-jar, when you have
skimmed it. Heat and boil slowly five minutes, skimming
it well. Drop in the balls very carefully—not to break
them; simmer ten minutes very gently, to avoid the same
catastrophe, and pour into the tureen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chicken and Ham Pie.</span></h3>

<p>1 chicken; 1 lb. of lean veal; ½ lb. corned ham; yolks
of 3 hard-boiled eggs; 1 cup of gravy or stock; ½ can of
mushrooms; pepper and salt; good paste for cover.</p>

<p>Joint the chicken; cut the veal and ham into dice,
slice the mushrooms and yolks; place in alternate layers,
seasoned with pepper and salt, in a large pudding-dish;
pour in the gravy, and cover with a thick crust of good
pastry. Ornament the edges, and make a slit in the
middle. Bake in a steady oven, and when almost done,
wash over with beaten egg.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rice Croquettes.</span></h3>

<p>2 cups of cold boiled rice; 2 tablespoonfuls of melted
butter; 3 beaten eggs; a little flour; 2 tablespoonfuls of
sugar; a large pinch of grated lemon-peel, and salt to
taste; raw egg and pounded cracker.</p>

<p>Beat eggs and sugar together, and work the butter into
the rice. Stir all together; season; make into croquettes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span>
roll in egg and cracker-crumbs, and fry, a few at
a time, in sweet lard. Drain, by rolling them on soft
white paper, and eat hot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stewed Salsify.</span></h3>

<p>Scrape, dropping into cold water as you do it; cook
tender in boiling salted water; drain this off; pour on a
cupful of drawn butter, and stew five minutes. Serve in a
hot, deep dish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Creamed Potatoes.</span></h3>

<p>Boil, and, while hot, slice the potatoes. Make a sauce
by heating a cup of milk, stirring into it a great spoonful
of butter, a scant teaspoonful of corn-starch, wet in cold
water, a little chopped parsley, and boiling until thickened.
Beat in the frothed white of an egg, and pour upon the
potatoes, which should first have been put into a deep dish
and sprinkled with pepper and salt.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cup Puddings.</span></h3>

<p>3 eggs; the weight of the eggs in flour, <i>prepared</i>; half
their weight in sugar; one-quarter of their weight in butter;
2 tablespoonfuls of milk; a little nutmeg.</p>

<p>Rub butter and sugar together; add the beaten yolks,
the milk; at last, the whisked whites and flour, alternately.
Bake in small buttered tins, or cups. Eat warm, without
or with sauce, according to your preference.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Noodle Soup.</span></h3>

<p>Empty your stock-jar into the soup-pot, adding as much
boiling water as you may need, with additional seasoning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[685]</a></span>
and any bones you may chance to have. Simmer one
hour, or more; strain, return to the fire, and boil and
skim for five minutes, before dropping in a generous
handful of noodles—dried, or fresh. Simmer twenty minutes.
For receipt for noodles, please consult Wednesday,
First Week in August.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Roast Pig.</span></h3>

<p>See that your butcher has done his part well in cleaning
the month-old pig. Rinse out with soda and water,
then with fair water, wiping the pig dry, inside and out.
Prepare a dressing of a cupful of crumbs, half a chopped
onion, two teaspoonfuls powdered sage, three tablespoonfuls
of melted butter, a saltspoonful of salt, and as much
pepper, half a grated nutmeg, and the yolks of two beaten
eggs. Moisten with half a cup of soup-stock, and stuff
the little fellow into his original size and shape. Sew him
up, and place in a kneeling posture in a dripping-pan,
skewering or tying his legs in the proper position.
Dredge with flour. Pour a little hot salted water in the
dripping-pan. Baste with butter and water three times as
the pig warms; afterward, with gravy from the dripping-pan.
When he begins to smoke all over, rub every ten
minutes with a rag dipped in melted butter. This will
keep the skin from cracking. Roast in a moderate,
steady oven two hours.</p>

<p>Put the innocent—still kneeling—upon a large hot
dish; surround with parsley and blanched celery-tops.
Put a wreath of green about his neck, and a sprig of celery
in his mouth.</p>

<p>Skim and strain the gravy; thicken with browned flour;
boil up, add a glass of wine and the juice of a lemon, and
serve in a boat.</p>

<p>In carving, cut off the head first; then split down the
back; take off hams and shoulders, and separate the ribs.</p>

of cloves, and the same, each, of allspice and
fine salt; 2½ lbs. of brown sugar; 1 quart brown sherry;
1 pint best brandy.</p>

<p>Mix all these thoroughly, putting in the liquor last.
Make it, <i>at least</i>, twenty-four hours before it is needed.
Keep in a stone jar, with a tight cover, and a piece of
bladder tied over the top. When ready to bake your
pies, line greased pie-dishes with good paste, put in the
mince-meat, and lay strips of pastry, notched with a jagging-iron
in a lattice pattern, over the top.</p>

<p>This mince-meat will keep all winter—if not used up.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Transparent Soup.</span></h3>

<p>4 lbs. of lean, coarse beef, cut into strips; 2 slices of
lean ham, also stripped; 2 tablespoonfuls of butter; 2
turnips; 1 carrot; 2 onions; 2 stalks of celery; pepper
and salt to taste; 1 tablespoonful of gelatine, soaked two
hours in a little cold water; 5 quarts of water; sweet
herbs.</p>

<p>Put the butter into the soup-kettle; when it heats, add
the meat, cover close, and set where it will heat without
scorching. In half an hour set directly over the fire
and stir until the meat is coated with a brown glaze. Put
in a pint of lukewarm water, and when this has boiled
down to one-half, add four quarts and a half of cold water;
skim off the top and boil slowly four hours. Cook, in a
separate saucepan, the sliced carrot, turnips, herbs, celery
and the onions; these last already sliced and fried in dripping.
Cover with a quart of water, and boil down to a
pint. Strain off the clear liquor, and add to the soup. Set
aside the vegetables without pulping them. Now, strain
off as much of the soup as is needed for to-day, and let it
cool. Put the rest, well seasoned with salt and pepper,
into the stock-jar with the boiled vegetables, and keep
for another day.</p>

<p>Take all the fat from your cooled soup, strain through
muslin back into the scalded soup-kettle, season, boil up
and skim; add the soaked gelatine, and stir until clear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span></p>

with onion, parsley, pepper and salt, and simmer forty-five
minutes, or until tender. Dish, and keep the rabbits hot;
strain the gravy, add a good lump of butter rolled in
browned flour, and a glass of wine; boil fairly and pour
over the rabbits.</p>

<p>Cream butter and sugar; add the beaten yolks, the
milk, then the flour and whipped whites, by turns. Last
of all, stir in the fruit, well dredged. Turn into a well-buttered
mould and boil steadily nearly three hours. Be
careful that the water does not bubble over the top of
the mould. When done, dip in cold water for one minute;
turn out, and eat with hot, sweet sauce.</p>

THE DINNER YEAR-BOOK.<br />

<b>By MARION HARLAND,</b><br />

<span class="smcap">Kitchen Edition in Oil-Cloth Covers at same Price.</span><br />
————————</div>



<p><span class="smcap">The Dinner Year-Book</span> is, in its name, happily descriptive of its purposes and character.
It occupies a place which, amid all the publications upon cookery—and their
name is Legion—<b>has never yet been occupied</b>.</p>

<p>The author truly says that there have been <span class="smcap">dinner-giving</span> books published, that is
books of <i>menus</i> for company dinings, “Little Dinners,” for especial occasions, etc., etc.;
but that she has never yet met with a <b>practical directory</b> of this important meal
<b>for every day in the year</b>. In this volume she has furnished the programme
in all its details, and has superintended the preparation of each dish, proceeding even to
the proper manner of serving it at the table. <b>The book has been prepared for
the family, for the home of ordinary means, and it has hit the
happy line where elegance and economy meet.</b></p>

<p>The most numerous testimonials to the value of Marion Harland’s “Common Sense”
books, which the publishers have received, both in newspaper notices and in private
communications, are to the effect—always expressed with some astonishment—that <b>the
directions of these receipts, actually followed, produce the promised
result</b>. We can prophesy the same for the new volume.</p>

<p>The purchaser will find that he has bought what the name purports—<i>The Dinner
Year-Book</i>—a practical guide for the purchase of the material and preparation, serving,
etc., of the ordinary home dinner for every day of the year. To these are added
<b>twelve company dinners</b>, one for each month, from which a selection can be
made—according to the time of the year—equal to any occasion which will be presented
to the housekeeper.</p>

<p>This book, however, is not valuable merely as a directory for dinners appropriate to
various seasons. It contains <b>the largest number of receipts</b> for soups, fish,
meat, vegetables, entrees of all descriptions, and desserts, <b>ever offered to the
American public</b>. The material for this work has been collected with great care,
both at home and abroad, representing the diligent labor of many months.</p>

<p><i>Note.—The original Edition of The Dinner Year Book, with six colored plates,
illustrating twenty-eight subjects, handsomely bound in cloth, will be continued in
print at the regular price, $2.25.</i></p>

<p>Messrs. <span class="smcap">Charles Scribner’s Sons</span> have now completed the issue of
a New Edition of Dr. Holland’s Writings, printed from new plates, in a very
attractive style, in artistic binding, and at a greatly reduced price.</p>

<p>It is believed that the aggregate sale of Dr. Holland’s Books, amounting
as it does to half a million volumes, exceeds the circulation of the writings of
any other American author. There is not a single book of his which has not
had an unquestionable success, and most of them have been in such constant
and increasing demand that the plates were actually worn out.</p>

<p><small>“<i>Dr. Holland will always find a congenial audience in the homes of culture and
refinement. He does not affect the play of the darker and fiercer passions, but delights
in the sweet images that cluster around the domestic hearth. He cherishes a
strong fellow-feeling with the pure and tranquil life in the modest social circles of
the American people, and has thus won his way to the companionship of many
friendly hearts.</i>”—<span class="smcap">N. Y. Tribune.</span></small></p></div>

proved themselves as appreciative in other respects of the needs of
American housewives, and as ingenious in meeting these. I call attention
to their wares, as a simple act of justice to what is so excellent
in itself, and as an unsolicited thank-offering to the stranger-benefactors
who have made many of my culinary duties a pastime, rather
than a toil.</p></div>

<b>Transcriber’s Notes:</b></div>


<p>Obvious punctuation errors repaired. Often the recipes will contain
ingredients in the instructions that were not included in the list of
ingredients. See, for example, <span class="smcap">Clear Gravy Soup</span> on page 55
where the first line mentions dicing onions that are not listed above.
About two-thirds of the way through the text, the printer stopped putting the
ingredients in lists and instead just used paragraphs. The recipes were retained as printed.</p>

<p>The index was also retained as printed. There is little rhyme nor
reason in its construction and the transcriber could not ascertain the
reasoning for the order of the items within.</p>

<p>Eight uses of “Pâté(s)” were changed to “Paté(s)” to match usage in
text. Text uses both “à la Crême” and “à la Crème” for all kinds of
vegetables.</p>

<p>“Meringue,” (and its other forms), were changed to “méringue” to match
the one hundred other occurrences in the text. These changes were made
on pages 46, 51, 62, 63 (three times), and 74 (twice).</p>

<p>The printer spells the fresh version of “Peach Lèche Crema” as “Peach
Lèche-Crêma” and the version that uses canned peaches as “Peach Lèche
Crèma.” Varied hyphenation retained where a majority consensus could not
be ascertained, for example: “arrow-root,” “arrowroot,” etc.</p>
